Enter Rodorigo and Iago

  Rodorigo Neuer tell me I take it much vnkindly
That thou Iago who hast had my purse
As if y strings were thine shouldst know of this

   Ia But youl not heare me If euer I did dream
Of such a matter abhorre me

   Rodo Thou toldst me
Thou didst hold him in thy hate

   Iago Despise me
If I do not Three Greatones of the Cittie
In personall suite to make me his Lieutenant
Offcapt to him and by the faith of man
I know my price I am worth no worsse a place
But he as louing his owne pride and purposes
Euades them with a bumbast Circumstance
Horribly stufft with Epithites of warre
Nonsuites my Mediators For certes saies he
I haue already chose my Officer And what was he
Forsooth a great Arithmatician
One Michaell Cassio a Florentine
A Fellow almost damnd in a faire Wife
That neuer set a Squadron in the Field
Nor the deuision of a Battaile knowes
More then a Spinster Vnlesse the Bookish Theoricke
Wherein the Tongued Consuls can propose
As Masterly as he Meere pratle without practise
Is all his Souldiership But he Sir had th election
And I of whom his eies had seene the proofe
At Rhodes at Ciprus and on others grounds
Christend and Heathen must be beleed and calmd
By Debitor and Creditor This Countercaster
He in good time must his Lieutenant be
And I blesse the marke his Mooreships Auntient

   Rod By heauen I rather would haue bin his hangman

   Iago Why theres no remedie
Tis the cursse of Seruice
Preferment goes by Letter and affection
And not by old gradation where each second
Stood Heire toth first Now Sir be iudge your selfe
Whether I in any iust terme am Affind
To loue the Moore
  Rod I would not follow him then

   Iago O Sir content you
I follow him to serue my turne vpon him
We cannot all be Masters nor all Masters
Cannot be truely followd You shall marke
Many a dutious and kneecrooking knaue
That doting on his owne obsequious bondage
Weares out his time much like his Masters Asse
For naught but Prouender  when hes old Casheerd
Whip me such honest knaues Others there are
Who trymd in Formes and visages of Dutie
Keepe yet their hearts attending on themselues
And throwing but showes of Seruice on their Lords
Doe well thriue by them
And when they haue lind their Coates
Doe themselues Homage
These Fellowes haue some soule
And such a one do I professe my selfe For Sir
It is as sure as you are Rodorigo
Were I the Moore I would not be Iago
In following him I follow but my selfe
Heauen is my Iudge not I for loue and dutie
But seeming so for my peculiar end
For when my outward Action doth demonstrate
The natiue act and figure of my heart
In Complement externe tis not long after
But I will weare my heart vpon my sleeue
For Dawes to pecke at I am not what I am

   Rod What a fall Fortune dos the Thickslips owe
If he can carryt thus
  Iago Call vp her Father
Rowse him make after him poyson his delight
Proclaime him in the Streets Incense her kinsmen
And though he in a fertile Clymate dwell
Plague him with Flies though that his Ioy be Ioy
Yet throw such chances of vexation ont
As it may loose some colour

   Rodo Heere is her Fathers house Ile call aloud

   Iago Doe with like timerous accent and dire yell
As when by Night and Negligence the Fire

My spirits and my place haue in their power
To make this bitter to thee

   Rodo Most graue Brabantio

  Ia I am one Sir that comes to tell you your Daughter

   Bra This thou shalt answere I know thee Rodorigo

   Rod Sir I will answere any thing But I beseech you
Ift be your pleasure and most wise consent
As partly I find it is that your faire Daughter
At this odde Euen and dull watch oth night

But with a knaue of common hire a Gundelier
To the grosse claspes of a Lasciuious Moore
If this be knowne to you and your Allowance
We then haue done you bold and saucie wrongs
But if you know not this my Manners tell me
We haue your wrong rebuke Do not beleeue
That from the sence of all Ciuilitie
I thus would play and trifle with your Reuerence
Your Daughter if you haue not giuen her leaue
I say againe hath made a grosse reuolt
Tying her Dutie Beautie Wit and Fortunes
In an extrauagant and wheeling Stranger
Of here and euery where straight satisfie your selfe
If she be in her Chamber or your house
Let loose on me the Iustice of the State
For thus deluding you

   Bra Strike on the Tinder hoa

This Accident is not vnlike my dreame
Beleefe of it oppresses me alreadie
Light I say light

  Iag Farewell for I must leaue you
It seemes not meete nor wholesome to my place
To be producted as if I stay I shall
Against the Moore For I do know the State
How euer this may gall him with some checke
Cannot with safetie casthim For hes embarkd
With such loud reason to the Cyprus Warres
Which euen now stands in Act that for their soules
Another of his Fadome they haue none
To lead their Businesse In which regard
Though I do hate him as I do hell paines
Yet for necessitie of present life
I must show out a Flag and signe of Loue
Which is indeed but signe that you shal surely find him
Lead to the Sagitary the raised Search
And there will I be with him So farewell

Enter Brabantio with Seruants and Torches

  Bra It is too true an euill Gone she is

Past thought what said she to you Get moe Tapers

  Rodo Truely I thinke they are

   Bra Oh Heauen how got she out

By what you see them act Is there not Charmes
By which the propertie of Youth and Maidhood
May be abusd Haue you not read Rodorigo
Of some such thing
  Rod Yes Sir I haue indeed

   Bra Call vp my Brother oh would you had had her

Sometime to do me seruice Nine or ten times
I had thought thaue yerkd him here vnder the Ribbes

   Othello Tis better as it is

   Iago Nay but he prated
And spoke such scuruy and prouoking termes
Against your Honor that with the little godlinesse I haue
I did full hard forbeare him But I pray you Sir
Are you fast married Be assurd of this
That the Magnifico is much beloud
And hath in his effect a voice potentiall
As double as the Dukes He will diuorce you
Or put vpon you what restraint or greeuance
The Law with all his might to enforce it on
Will giue him Cable

   Othel Let him do his spight
My Seruices which I haue done the Signorie
Shall outtongue his Complaints Tis yet to know
Which when I know that boasting is an Honour
I shall promulgate I fetch my life and being
From Men of Royall Seige And my demerites
May speake vnbonnetted to as proud a Fortune
As this that I haue reachd For know Iago

Haue sent a dozen sequent Messengers
This very night at one anothers heeles
And many of the Consuls raisd and met
Are at the Dukes already You haue bin hotly calld for

   Iago You Rodorigo Come Sir I am for you

   Othe Keepe vp your bright Swords for the dew will
rust them Good Signior you shall more command with
yeares then with your Weapons

   Bra Oh thou foule Theefe
Where hast thou stowd my Daughter
Damnd as thou art thou hast enchaunted her
For Ile referre me to all things of sense
If she in Chaines of Magick were not bound
Whether a Maid so tender Faire and Happie
So opposite to Marriage that she shund
The wealthy curled Deareling of our Nation
Would euer haue t encurre a generall mocke
Run from her Guardage to the sootie bosome
Of such a thing as thou to feare not to delight
Iudge me the world if tis not grosse in sense
That thou hast practisd on her with foule Charmes
Abusd her delicate Youth with Drugs or Minerals
That weakens Motion Ile hauet disputed on
Tis probable and palpable to thinking
I therefore apprehend and do attach thee
For an abuser of the World a practiser
Of Arts inhibited and out of warrant
Lay hold vpon him if he do resist
Subdue him at his perill

   Othe Hold your hands
Both you of my inclining and the rest
Were it my Cue to fight I should haue knowne it
Without a Prompter Whether will you that I goe
To answere this your charge
  Bra To Prison till fit time
Of Law and course of direct Session
Call thee to answer

   Othe What if I do obey
How may the Duke be therewith satisfid
Whose Messengers are heere about my side
Vpon some present businesse of the State
To bring me to him

   Officer Tis true most worthy Signior
The Dukes in Counsell and your Noble selfe
I am sure is sent for

   Bra How The Duke in Counsell
In this time of the night Bring him away
Mines not an idle Cause The Duke himselfe
Or any of my Brothers of the State
Cannot but feele this wrong as twere their owne
For if such Actions may haue passage free
Bondslaues and Pagans shall our Statesmen be

Exeunt

Scaena Tertia

Enter Duke Senators and Officers

  Duke Theres no composition in this Newes
That giues them Credite

   1Sen Indeed they are disproportioned
My Letters say a Hundred and seuen Gallies

   Duke And mine a Hundred fortie

   2Sena And mine two Hundred
But though they iumpe not on a iust accompt
As in these Cases where the ayme reports
Tis oft with difference yet do they all confirme
A Turkish Fleete and bearing vp to Cyprus

   Duke Nay it is possible enough to iudgement
I do not so secure me in the Error
But the maine Article I do approue
In fearefull sense

   Saylor within What hoa what hoa what hoa

Enter Saylor

  Officer A Messenger from the Gallies

   Duke Now Whats the businesse
  Sailor The Turkish Preparation makes for Rhodes
So was I bid report here to the State
By Signior Angelo

   Duke How say you by this change
  1Sen This cannot be
By no assay of reason Tis a Pageant
To keepe vs in false gaze when we consider
Th importancie of Cyprus to the Turke
And let our selues againe but vnderstand
That as it more concernes the Turke then Rhodes
So may he with more facile question beare it
For that it stands not in such Warrelike brace
But altogether lackes th abilities
That Rhodes is dressd in If we make thought of this
We must not thinke the Turke is so vnskillfull
To leaue that latest which concernes him first
Neglecting an attempt of ease and gaine
To wake and wage a danger profitlesse

   Duke Nay in all confidence hes not for Rhodes

   Officer Here is more Newes

Enter a Messenger

  Messen The Ottamites Reuerend and Gracious
Steering with due course toward the Ile of Rhodes
Haue there inioynted them with an after Fleete

   1Sen I so I thought how many as you guesse
  Mess Of thirtie Saile and now they do restem
Their backward course bearing with frank appearance
Their purposes toward Cyprus Signior Montano
Your trustie and most Valiant Seruitour
With his free dutie recommends you thus
And prayes you to beleeue him

   Duke Tis certaine then for Cyprus
Marcus Luccicos is not he in Towne
  1Sen Hes now in Florence

   1Sen Here comes Brabantio and the Valiant Moore

Enter Brabantio Othello Cassio Iago Rodorigo and Officers

  Duke Valiant Othello we must straight employ you
Against the generall Enemy Ottoman
I did not see you welcome gentle Signior
We lackt your Counsaile and your helpe to night

   Bra So did I yours Good your Grace pardon me
Neither my place nor ought I heard of businesse
Hath raisd me from my bed nor doth the generall care
Take hold on me For my perticular griefe
Is of so floodgate and orebearing Nature
That it engluts and swallowes other sorrowes
And it is still it selfe

   Duke Why Whats the matter
  Bra My Daughter oh my Daughter
  Sen Dead
  Bra I to me
She is abusd stolne from me and corrupted
By Spels and Medicines bought of Mountebanks
For Nature so prepostrously to erre
Being not deficient blind or lame of sense
Sans witchcraft could not

   Duke Who ere he be that in this foule proceeding
Hath thus beguild your Daughter of her selfe
And you of her the bloodie Booke of Law
You shall your selfe read in the bitter letter
After your owne sense yea though our proper Son
Stood in your Action

   Bra Humbly I thanke your Grace
Here is the man this Moore whom now it seemes
Your speciall Mandate for the State affaires
Hath hither brought

   All We are verie sorry fort

   Duke What in your owne part can you say to this
  Bra Nothing but this is so

   Othe Most Potent Graue and Reuerend Signiors
My very Noble and approud good Masters
That I haue tane away this old mans Daughter
It is most true true I haue married her
The verie head and front of my offending
Hath this extent no more Rude am I in my speech
And little blessd with the soft phrase of Peace
For since these Armes of mine had seuen yeares pith
Till now some nine Moones wasted they haue vsd
Their deerest action in the Tented Field
And little of this great world can I speake
More then pertaines to Feats of Broiles and Battaile
And therefore little shall I grace my cause
In speaking for my selfe Yet by your gratious patience
I will a round vnvarnishd Tale deliuer
Of my whole course of Loue
What Drugges what Charmes
What Coniuration and what mighty Magicke
For such proceeding I am chargd withall
I won his Daughter

   Bra A Maiden neuer bold
Of Spirit so still and quiet that her Motion
Blushd at her selfe and she in spight of Nature
Of Yeares of Country Credite euery thing
To fall in Loue with what she feard to looke on
It is a iudgement maind and most imperfect
That will confesse Perfection so could erre
Against all rules of Nature and must be driuen
To find out practises of cunning hell
Why this should be I therefore vouch againe
That with some Mixtures powrefull ore the blood
Or with some Dram coniurd to this effect
He wrought vpon her
To vouch this is no proofe
Without more wider and more ouer Test
Then these thin habits and poore likelyhoods
Of moderne seeming do prefer against him

   Sen But Othello speake
Did you by indirect and forced courses
Subdue and poyson this yong Maides affections
Or came it by request and such faire question
As soule to soule affordeth
  Othel I do beseech you
Send for the Lady to the Sagitary
And let her speake of me before her Father
If you do finde me foule in her report
The Trust the Office I do hold of you
Not onely take away but let your Sentence
Euen fall vpon my life

   Duke Fetch Desdemona hither

   Othe Aunciant conduct them
You best know the place
And tell she come as truely as to heauen
I do confesse the vices of my blood
So iustly to your Graue eares Ile present
How I did thriue in this faire Ladies loue
And she in mine

   Duke Say it Othello

   Othe Her Father loud me oft inuited me
Still questiond me the Storie of my life
From yeare to yeare the Battaile Sieges Fortune
That I haue past
I ran it through euen from my boyish daies
Toth very moment that he bad me tell it
Wherein I spoke of most disastrous chances
Of mouing Accidents by Flood and Field
Of hairebreadth scapes ith imminent deadly breach
Of being taken by the Insolent Foe
And sold to slauery Of my redemption thence
And portance in my Trauellours historie
Wherein of Antars vast and Desarts idle
Rough Quarries Rocks Hills whose head touch heauen
It was my hint to speake Such was my Processe
And of the Canibals that each others eate
The Antropophague and men whose heads
Grew beneath their shoulders These things to heare
Would Desdemona seriously incline
But still the house Affaires would draw her hence
Which euer as she could with haste dispatch
Sheld come againe and with a greedie eare
Deuoure vp my discourse Which I obseruing
Tooke once a pliant houre and found good meanes
To draw from her a prayer of earnest heart
That I would all my Pilgrimage dilate
Whereof by parcels she had something heard
But not instinctiuely I did consent
And often did beguile her of her teares
When I did speake of some distressefull stroke
That my youth sufferd My Storie being done
She gaue me for my paines a world of kisses
She swore in faith twas strange twas passing strange
Twas pittifull twas wondrous pittifull
She wishd she had not heard it yet she wishd
That Heauen had made her such a man She thankd me
And bad me if I had a Friend that loud her
I should but teach him how to tell my Story
And that would wooe her Vpon this hint I spake
She loud me for the dangers I had past
And I loud her that she did pitty them
This onely is the witchcraft I haue vsd
Here comes the Ladie Let her witnesse it

Enter Desdemona Iago Attendants

  Duke I thinke this tale would win my Daughter too
Good Brabantio take vp this mangled matter at the best
Men do their broken Weapons rather vse
Then their bare hands

   Bra I pray you heare her speake
If she confesse that she was halfe the wooer
Destruction on my head if my bad blame
Light on the man Come hither gentle Mistris
Do you perceiue in all this Noble Companie
Where most you owe obedience
  Des My Noble Father
I do perceiue heere a diuided dutie
To you I am bound for life and education
My life and education both do learne me
How to respect you You are the Lord of duty
I am hitherto your Daughter But heeres my Husband
And so much dutie as my Mother shewd
To you preferring you before her Father
So much I challenge that I may professe
Due to the Moore my Lord

   Bra God be with you I haue done
Please it your Grace on to the State Affaires
I had rather to adopt a Child then get it
Come hither Moore
I here do giue thee that with all my heart
Which but thou hast already with all my heart
I would keepe from thee For your sake Iewell
I am glad at soule I haue no other Child
For thy escape would teach me Tirranie
To hang clogges on them I haue done my Lord

   Duke Let me speake like your selfe
And lay a Sentence
Which as a grise or step may helpe these Louers
When remedies are past the griefes are ended
By seeing the worst which late on hopes depended
To mourne a Mischeefe that is past and gon
Is the next way to draw new mischiefe on
What cannot be preserud when Fortune takes
Patience her Iniury a mockry makes
The robd that smiles steales something from the Thiefe
He robs himselfe that spends a bootelesse griefe

   Bra So let the Turke of Cyprus vs beguile
We loose it not so long as we can smile
He beares the Sentence well that nothing beares
But the free comfort which from thence he heares
But he beares both the Sentence and the sorrow
That to pay griefe must of poore Patience borrow
These Sentences to Sugar or to Gall
Being strong on both sides are Equiuocall
But words are words I neuer yet did heare
That the bruized heart was piercd through the eares
I humbly beseech you proceed to th Affaires of State

   Duke The Turke with a most mighty Preparation
makes for Cyprus Othello the Fortitude of the place is
best knowne to you And though we haue there a Substitute
of most allowed sufficiencie yet opinion a more
soueraigne Mistris of Effects throwes a more safer
voice on you you must therefore be content to slubber
the glosse of your new Fortunes with this more stubborne
and boystrous expedition

   Othe The Tirant Custome most Graue Senators
Hath made the flinty and Steele Coach of Warre
My thricedriuen bed of Downe I do agnize
A Naturall and prompt Alacratie
I finde in hardnesse and do vndertake
This present Warres against the Ottamites
Most humbly therefore bending to your State
I craue fit disposition for my Wife
Due reference of Place and Exhibition
With such Accomodation and besort
As leuels with her breeding

   Duke Why at her Fathers
  Bra I will not haue it so

   Othe Nor I

   Des Nor would I there recide
To put my Father in impatient thoughts
By being in his eye Most Gracious Duke
To my vnfolding lend your prosperous eare
And let me finde a Charter in your voice
T assist my simplenesse

   Duke What would you Desdemona
  Des That I loue the Moore to liue with him
My downeright violence and storme of Fortunes
May trumpet to the world My hearts subdud
Euen to the very quality of my Lord
I saw Othellos visage in his mind
And to his Honours and his valiant parts
Did I my soule and Fortunes consecrate
So that deere Lords if I be left behind
A Moth of Peace and he go to the Warre
The Rites for why I loue him are bereft me
And I a heauie interim shall support
By his deere absence Let me go with him

   Othe Let her haue your voice
Vouch with me Heauen I therefore beg it not
To please the pallate of my Appetite
Nor to comply with heat the yong affects
In my defunct and proper satisfaction
But to be free and bounteous to her minde
And Heauen defend your good soules that you thinke
I will your serious and great businesse scant
When she is with me No when light wingd Toyes
Of featherd Cupid seele with wanton dulnesse
My speculatiue and officd Instrument
That my Disports corrupt and taint my businesse
Let Housewiues make a Skillet of my Helme
And all indigne and base aduersities
Make head against my Estimation

   Duke Be it as you shall priuately determine
Either for her stay or going th Affaire cries hast
And speed must answer it

   Sen You must away to night

   Othe With all my heart

   Duke At nine ith morning here weel meete againe
Othello leaue some Officer behind
And he shall our Commission bring to you
And such things else of qualitie and respect
As doth import you

   Othe So please your Grace my Ancient
A man he is of honesty and trust

Enter

  Rod Iago

   Iago What saist thou Noble heart
  Rod What will I do thinkst thou
  Iago Why go to bed and sleepe

   Rod I will incontinently drowne my selfe

   Iago If thou dost I shall neuer loue thee after Why
thou silly Gentleman
  Rod It is sillynesse to liue when to liue is torment
and then haue we a prescription to dye when death is
our Physition

   Iago Oh villanous I haue lookd vpon the world
for foure times seuen yeares and since I could distinguish
betwixt a Benefit and an Iniurie I neuer found man that
knew how to loue himselfe Ere I would say I would
drowne my selfe for the loue of a Gynney Hen I would
change my Humanity with a Baboone

   Rod What should I do I confesse it is my shame
to be so fond but it is not in my vertue to amend it

   Iago Vertue A figge tis in our selues that we are
thus or thus Our Bodies are our Gardens to the which
our Wills are Gardiners So that if we will plant Nettels
or sowe Lettice Set Hisope and weede vp Time
Supplie it with one gender of Hearbes or distract it with
many either to haue it sterrill with idlenesse or manured
with Industry why the power and Corrigeable authoritie
of this lies in our Wills If the braine of our liues
had not one Scale of Reason to poize another of Sensualitie
the blood and basenesse of our Natures would
conduct vs to most prepostrous Conclusions But we
haue Reason to coole our raging Motions our carnall
Stings or vnbitted Lusts whereof I take this that you
call Loue to be a Sect or Seyen

   Rod It cannot be

   Iago It is meerly a Lust of the blood and a permission
of the will Come be a man drowne thy selfe Drown
Cats and blind Puppies I haue profest me thy Friend
and I confesse me knit to thy deseruing with Cables of
perdurable toughnesse I could neuer better steed thee
then now Put Money in thy purse follow thou the
Warres defeate thy fauour with an vsurpd Beard I say
put Money in thy purse It cannot be long that Desdemona
should continue her loue to the Moore Put Money in
thy purse nor he his to her It was a violent Commencement
in her and thou shalt see an answerable Sequestration
put but Money in thy purse These Moores
are changeable in their wils fill thy purse with Money
The Food that to him now is as lushious as Locusts
shalbe to him shortly as bitter as Coloquintida She
must change for youth when she is sated with his body
she will find the errors of her choice Therefore put Money
in thy purse If thou wilt needs damne thy selfe do
it a more delicate way then drowning Make all the Money
thou canst If Sanctimonie and a fraile vow betwixt
an erring Barbarian and supersubtle Venetian be
not too hard for my wits and all the Tribe of hell thou
shalt enioy her therefore make Money a pox of drowning
thy selfe it is cleane out of the way Seeke thou rather
to be hangd in Compassing thy ioy then to be
drownd and go without her

   Rodo Wilt thou be fast to my hopes if I depend on
the issue
  Iago Thou art sure of me Go make Money I haue
told thee often and I retell thee againe and againe I
hate the Moore My cause is hearted thine hath no lesse
reason Let vs be coniunctiue in our reuenge against
him If thou canst Cuckold him thou dost thy selfe a
pleasure me a sport There are many Euents in the
Wombe of Time which wilbe deliuered Trauerse go
prouide thy Money We will haue more of this to morrow
Adieu

   Rod Where shall we meete ith morning
  Iago At my Lodging

   Rod Ile be with thee betimes

   Iago Go too farewell Do you heare Rodorigo
  Rod Ile sell all my Land
Enter

  Iago Thus do I euer make my Foole my purse
For I mine owne gaind knowledge should prophane
If I would time expend with such Snipe
But for my Sport and Profit I hate the Moore
And it is thought abroad that twixt my sheets
She has done my Office I know not ift be true
But I for meere suspition in that kinde
Will do as if for Surety He holds me well
The better shall my purpose worke on him
Cassios a proper man Let me see now
To get his Place and to plume vp my will
In double Knauery How How Lets see
After some time to abuse Othellos eares
That he is too familiar with his wife
He hath a person and a smooth dispose
To be suspected framd to make women false
The Moore is of a free and open Nature
That thinkes men honest that but seeme to be so
And will as tenderly be lead byth Nose
As Asses are
I haut it is engendred Hell and Night
Must bring this monstrous Birth to the worlds light

If such tricks as these strip you out of your Lieutenantrie
it had beene better you had not kissd your three fingers

Enter Othello and Attendants

  Oth O my faire Warriour

   Des My deere Othello

   Othe It giues me wonder great as my content
To see you heere before me
Oh my Soules Ioy
If after euery Tempest come such Calmes
May the windes blow till they haue wakend death
And let the labouring Barke climbe hills of Seas
Olympus high and duck againe as low
As hells from Heauen If it were now to dye
Twere now to be most happy For I feare
My Soule hath her content so absolute
That not another comfort like to this
Succeedes in vnknowne Fate

   Des The Heauens forbid
But that our Loues
And Comforts should encrease
Euen as our dayes do grow

   Othe Amen to that sweet Powers
I cannot speake enough of this content
It stoppes me heere it is too much of ioy
And this and this the greatest discords be
That ere our hearts shall make

   Iago Oh you are well tund now But Ile set downe
the peggs that make this Musicke as honest as I am

   Othe Come let vs to the Castle
Newes Friends our Warres are done
The Turkes are drownd
How dos my old Acquaintance of this Isle
Hony you shall be well desird in Cyprus
I haue found great loue amongst them Oh my Sweet
I prattle out of fashion and I doate
In mine owne comforts I prythee good Iago
Go to the Bay and disimbarke my Coffers
Bring thou the Master to the Cittadell
He is a good one and his worthynesse
Dos challenge much respect Come Desdemona
Once more well met at Cyprus

Exit Othello and Desdemona

  Iago Do thou meet me presently at the Harbour
Come thither if thou best Valiant as they say base men
being in Loue haue then a Nobilitie in their Natures
more then is natiue to them listme the Lieutenant to
night watches on the Court of Guard First I must tell
thee this Desdemona is directly in loue with him

   Rod With him Why tis not possible

   Iago Lay thy finger thus and let thy soule be instructed
Marke me with what violence she first loud
the Moore but for bragging and telling her fantasticall
lies To loue him still for prating let not thy discreet
heart thinke it Her eye must be fed And what delight
shall she haue to looke on the diuell When the Blood
is made dull with the Act of Sport there should be a
game to enflame it and to giue Satiety a fresh appetite
Louelinesse in fauour simpathy in yeares Manners
and Beauties all which the Moore is defectiue in Now
for want of these requird Conueniences her delicate
tendernesse wil finde it selfe abusd begin to heaue the
gorge disrellish and abhorre the Moore very Nature wil
instruct her in it and compell her to some second choice
Now Sir this granted as it is a most pregnant and vnforcd
position who stands so eminent in the degree of
this Fortune as Cassio dos a knaue very voluble no
further conscionable then in putting on the meere forme
of Ciuill and Humaine seeming for the better compasse
of his salt and most hidden loose Affection Why none
why none A slipper and subtle knaue a finder of occasion
that hes an eye can stampe and counterfeit Aduantages
though true Aduantage neuer present it selfe
A diuelish knaue besides the knaue is handsome young
and hath all those requisites in him that folly and greene
mindes looke after A pestilent compleat knaue and the
woman hath found him already

   Rodo I cannot beleeue that in her shes full of most
blessd condition

   Iago Blessd figgesend The Wine she drinkes is
made of grapes If shee had beene blessd shee would
neuer haue loud the Moore Blessd pudding Didst thou
not see her paddle with the palme of his hand Didst not
marke that
  Rod Yes that I did but that was but curtesie

   Iago  Leacherie by this hand an Index and obscure
prologue to the History of Lust and foule Thoughts
They met so neere with their lippes that their breathes
embracd together Villanous thoughts Rodorigo when
these mutabilities so marshall the way hard at hand
comes the Master and maine exercise th incorporate
conclusion Pish But Sir be you ruld by me I haue
brought you from Venice Watch you to night for
the Command Ile layt vpon you Cassio knowes you
not Ile not be farre from you Do you finde some occasion
to anger Cassio either by speaking too loud or
tainting his discipline or from what other course
you please which the time shall more fauorably minister

   Rod Well

   Iago Sir hes rash and very sodaine in Choller and
happely may strike at you prouoke him that he may for
euen out of that will I cause these of Cyprus to Mutiny
Whose qualification shall come into no true taste againe
but by the displanting of Cassio So shall you
haue a shorter iourney to your desires by the meanes I
shall then haue to preferre them And the impediment
most profitably remoued without the which there were
no expectation of our prosperitie

   Rodo I will do this if you can bring it to any opportunity

   Iago I warrant thee Meete me by and by at the
Cittadell I must fetch his Necessaries a Shore Farewell

   Rodo Adieu
Enter

  Iago That Cassio loues her I do well beleeut
That she loues him tis apt and of great Credite
The Moore howbeit that I endure him not
Is of a constant louing Noble Nature
And I dare thinke hele proue to Desdemona
A most deere husband Now I do loue her too
Not out of absolute Lust though peraduenture
I stand accomptant for as great a sin
But partely led to dyet my Reuenge
For that I do suspect the lustie Moore
Hath leapd into my Seate The thought whereof
Doth like a poysonous Minerall gnaw my Inwardes
And nothing can or shall content my Soule
Till I am eeuend with him wife for wife
Or fayling so yet that I put the Moore
At least into a Ielouzie so strong
That iudgement cannot cure Which thing to do
If this poore Trash of Venice whom I trace
For his quicke hunting stand the putting on
Ile haue our Michael Cassio on the hip
Abuse him to the Moore in the right garbe
For I feare Cassio with my NightCape too
Make the Moore thanke me loue me and reward me
For making him egregiously an Asse
And practising vpon his peace and quiet
Euen to madnesse Tis heere but yet confusd
Knaueries plaine face is neuer seene till vsd

Prizes the vertue that appeares in Cassio
And lookes not on his euills is not this true
Enter Rodorigo

  Iago How now Rodorigo

Should hazard such a Place as his owne Second
With one of an ingraft Infirmitie

To the Moore

   Oth Why how now hoa From whence ariseth this
Are we turnd Turkes and to our selues do that
Which Heauen hath forbid the Ottamittes
For Christian shame put by this barbarous Brawle
He that stirs next to carue for his owne rage
Holds his soule light He dies vpon his Motion
Silence that dreadfull Bell it frights the Isle
From her propriety What is the matter Masters
Honest Iago that lookes dead with greeuing
Speake who began this On thy loue I charge thee
  Iago I do not know Friends all but now euen now
In Quarter and in termes like Bride and Groome
Deuesting them for Bed and then but now
As if some Planet had vnwitted men
Swords out and tilting one at others breastes
In opposition bloody I cannot speake
Any begining to this peeuish oddes
And would in Action glorious I had lost
Those legges that brought me to a part of it

   Othe How comes it Michaell you are thus forgot
  Cas I pray you pardon me I cannot speake

   Othe Worthy Montano you were wont to be ciuill
The grauitie and stillnesse of your youth
The world hath noted And your name is great
In mouthes of wisest Censure Whats the matter
That you vnlace your reputation thus
And spend your rich opinion for the name
Of a nightbrawler Giue me answer to it

   Mon Worthy Othello I am hurt to danger
Your Officer Iago can informe you
While I spare speech which something now offends me
Of all that I do know nor know I ought
By me thats said or done amisse this night
Vnlesse selfecharitie be sometimes a vice
And to defend our selues it be a sinne
When violence assailes vs

   Othe Now by Heauen
My blood begins my safer Guides to rule
And passion hauing my best iudgement collied
Assaies to leade the way If I once stir
Or do but lift this Arme the best of you
Shall sinke in my rebuke Giue me to know
How this foule Rout began Who set it on
And he that is approud in this offence
Though he had twinnd with me both at a birth
Shall loose me What in a Towne of warre
Yet wilde the peoples hearts brimfull of feare
To Manage priuate and domesticke Quarrell
In night and on the Court and Guard of safetie
Tis monstrous Iago who begant
  Mon If partially Affind or league in office
Thou dost deliuer more or lesse then Truth
Thou art no Souldier

   Iago Touch me not so neere
I had rather haue this tongue cut from my mouth
Then it should do offence to Michaell Cassio
Yet I perswade my selfe to speake the truth
Shall nothing wrong him This it is Generall
Montano and my selfe being in speech
There comes a Fellow crying out for helpe
And Cassio following him with determind Sword
To execute vpon him Sir this Gentleman
Steppes in to Cassio and entreats his pause
My selfe the crying Fellow did pursue
Least by his clamour as it so fell out
The Towne might fall in fright He swift of foote
Outran my purpose and I returnd then rather
For that I heard the clinke and fall of Swords
And Cassio high in oath Which till to night
I nere might say before When I came backe
For this was briefe I found them close together
At blow and thrust euen as againe they were
When you your selfe did part them
More of this matter cannot I report
But Men are Men The best sometimes forget
Though Cassio did some little wrong to him
As men in rage strike those that wish them best
Yet surely Cassio I beleeue receiud
From him that fled some strange Indignitie
Which patience could not passe

   Othe I know Iago
Thy honestie and loue doth mince this matter
Making it light to Cassio Cassio I loue thee
But neuer more be Officer of mine
Enter Desdemona attended

Looke if my gentle Loue be not raisd vp

myselfe and what remaines is bestiall My Reputation
Iago my Reputation

   Iago As I am an honest man I had thought you had
receiued some bodily wound there is more sence in that
then in Reputation Reputation is an idle and most false
imposition oft got without merit and lost without deseruing
You haue lost no Reputation at all vnlesse you
repute your selfe such a looser What man there are
more wayes to recouer the Generall againe You are
but now cast in his moode a punishment more in policie
then in malice euen so as one would beate his offencelesse
dogge to affright an Imperious Lyon Sue to
him againe and hes yours

   Cas I will rather sue to be despisd then to deceiue
so good a Commander with so slight so drunken and so
indiscreet an Officer Drunke And speake Parrat And
squabble Swagger Sweare And discourse Fustian
with ones owne shadow Oh thou invisible spirit of
Wine if thou hast no name to be knowne by let vs call

   Iago What was he that you followd with your
Sword What had he done to you
  Cas I know not

   Iago Ist possible
  Cas I remember a masse of things but nothing distinctly
a Quarrell but nothing wherefore Oh that
men should put an Enemie in their mouthes to steale away
their Braines that we should with ioy pleasance
reuell and applause transforme our selues into Beasts

   Iago Why But you are now well enough how
came you thus recouered
  Cas It hath pleasd the diuell drunkennesse to giue
place to the diuell wrath one vnperfectnesse shewes me
another to make me frankly despise my selfe

   Iago Come you are too seuere a Moraller As the
Time the Place  the Condition of this Country stands
I could hartily wish this had not befalne but since it is as
it is mend it for your owne good

   Cas I will aske him for my Place againe he shall tell
me I am a drunkard had I as many mouthes as Hydra
such an answer would stop them all To be now a sensible
man by and by a Foole and presently a Beast Oh
strange Euery inordinate cup is vnblessd and the Ingredient
is a diuell

   Iago Come come good wine is a good familiar
Creature if it be well vsd exclaime no more against it
And good Lieutenant I thinke you thinke I loue

   Cassio I haue well approued it Sir I drunke
  Iago You or any man liuing may be drunke at a
time man I tell you what you shall do Our Generals
Wife is now the Generall I may say so in this respect
for that he hath deuoted and giuen vp himselfe to the
Contemplation marke and deuotement of her parts
and Graces Confesse your selfe freely to her Importune
her helpe to put you in your place againe She is
of so free so kinde so apt so blessed a disposition
she holds it a vice in her goodnesse not to do more
then she is requested This broken ioynt betweene
you and her husband entreat her to splinter And my
Fortunes against any lay worth naming this cracke of
your Loue shall grow stronger then it was before

   Cassio You aduise me well

   Iago I protest in the sinceritie of Loue and honest
kindnesse

   Cassio I thinke it freely and betimes in the morning
I will beseech the vertuous Desdemona to vndertake
for me I am desperate of my Fortunes if they check me

   Iago You are in the right good night Lieutenant I
must to the Watch

   Cassio Good night honest Iago

Exit Cassio

  Iago And whats he then
That saies I play the Villaine
When this aduise is free I giue and honest
Proball to thinking and indeed the course
To win the Moore againe
For tis most easie
Th inclyning Desdemona to subdue
In any honest Suite Shes framd as fruitefull
As the free Elements And then for her
To win the Moore were to renownce his Baptisme
All Seales and Simbols of redeemed sin
His Soule is so enfetterd to her Loue
That she may make vnmake do what she list
Euen as her Appetite shall play the God
With his weake Function How am I then a Villaine
To Counsell Cassio to this paralell course
Directly to his good Diuinitie of hell
When diuels will the blackest sinnes put on
They do suggest at first with heauenly shewes
As I do now For whiles this honest Foole
Plies Desdemona to repaire his Fortune
And she for him pleades strongly to the Moore
Ile powre this pestilence into his eare
That she repeales him for her bodies Lust
And by how much she striues to do him good
She shall vndo her Credite with the Moore
So will I turne her vertue into pitch
And out of her owne goodnesse make the Net
That shall enmash them all
How now Rodorigo
Enter Rodorigo

  Rodorigo I do follow heere in the Chace not
like a Hound that hunts but one that filles vp the
Crie My Money is almost spent I haue bin to night
exceedingly well Cudgelld And I thinke the issue
will bee I shall haue so much experience for my paines
And so with no money at all and a little more Wit returne
againe to Venice

   Iago How poore are they that haue not Patience
What wound did euer heale but by degrees
Thou knowst we worke by Wit and not by Witchcraft
And Wit depends on dilatory time
Dost not go well Cassio hath beaten thee
And thou by that small hurt hath casheerd Cassio
Though other things grow faire against the Sun
Yet Fruites that blossome first will first be ripe
Content thy selfe awhile Introth tis Morning
Pleasure and Action make the houres seeme short
Retire thee go where thou art Billited
Away I say thou shalt know more heereafter
Nay get thee gone

Exit Roderigo

Two things are to be done
My Wife must moue for Cassio to her Mistris

He might not but refuse you But he protests he loues you
And needs no other Suitor but his likings
To bring you in againe

   Oth Went he hence now
  Des I sooth so humbled

To suffer with him Good Loue call him backe

I prythee name the time but let it not
Exceed three dayes Infaith hees penitent
And yet his Trespasse in our common reason
Saue that they say the warres must make example
Out of her best is not almost a fault
T encurre a priuate checke When shall he come
Tell me Othello I wonder in my Soule
What you would aske me that I should deny
Or stand so mamring on What Michael Cassio
That came a woing with you and so many a time
When I haue spoke of you dispraisingly
Hath tane your part to haue so much to do
To bring him in Trust me I could do much

   Oth Prythee no more Let him come when he will
I will deny thee nothing

   Des Why this is not a Boone
Tis as I should entreate you weare your Gloues
Or feede on nourishing dishes or keepe you warme
Or sue to you to do a peculiar profit
To your owne person Nay when I haue a suite
Wherein I meane to touch your Loue indeed
It shall be full of poize and difficult waight
And fearefull to be granted

   Oth I will deny thee nothing
Whereon I do beseech thee grant me this
To leaue me but a little to my selfe

   Des Shall I deny you No farewell my Lord

   Oth Farewell my Desdemona Ile come to thee strait

   Des aemilia come be as your Fancies teach you

  Oth Excellent wretch Perdition catch my Soule
But I do loue thee and when I loue thee not
Chaos is come againe

   Iago My Noble Lord

   Oth What dost thou say Iago
  Iago Did Michael Cassio
When he wood my Lady know of your loue
  Oth He did from first to last
Why dost thou aske
  Iago But for a satisfaction of my Thought
No further harme

   Oth Why of thy thought Iago
  Iago I did not thinke he had bin acquainted with hir

   Oth O yes and went betweene vs very oft

   Iago Indeed
  Oth Indeed I indeed Discernst thou ought in that
Is he not honest
  Iago Honest my Lord
  Oth Honest I Honest

   Iago My Lord for ought I know

   Oth What dost thou thinke
  Iago Thinke my Lord
  Oth Thinke my Lord Alas thou ecchost me
As if there were some Monster in thy thought
Too hideous to be shewne Thou dost mean somthing
I heard thee say euen now thou likst not that
When Cassio left my wife What diddst not like
And when I told thee he was of my Counsaile
Of my whole course of wooing thou criedst Indeede
And diddst contract and purse thy brow together
As if thou then haddst shut vp in thy Braine
Some horrible Conceite If thou dost loue me
Shew me thy thought

   Iago My Lord you know I loue you

   Oth I thinke thou dost
And for I know thourt full of Loue and Honestie
And weighst thy words before thou giust them breath
Therefore these stops of thine fright me the more
For such things in a false disloyall Knaue
Are trickes of Custome but in a man thats iust
Theyre close dilations working from the heart
That Passion cannot rule

   Iago For Michael Cassio
I dare be sworne I thinke that he is honest

   Oth I thinke so too

   Iago Men should be what they seeme
Or those that be not would they might seeme none

   Oth Certaine men should be what they seeme

   Iago Why then I thinke Cassios an honest man

   Oth Nay yet theres more in this
I prythee speake to me as to thy thinkings
As thou dost ruminate and giue thy worst of thoughts
The worst of words

   Iago Good my Lord pardon me
Though I am bound to euery Acte of dutie
I am not bound to that All Slaues are free
Vtter my Thoughts Why say they are vild and falce
As wheres that Palace whereinto foule things
Sometimes intrude not Who has that breast so pure
Wherein vncleanly Apprehensions
Keepe Leetes and Lawdayes and in Sessions sit
With meditations lawfull
  Oth Thou dost conspire against thy Friend Iago
If thou but thinkst him wrongd and makst his eare
A stranger to thy Thoughts

   Iago I do beseech you
Though I perchance am vicious in my guesse
As I confesse it is my Natures plague
To spy into Abuses and of my iealousie
Shapes faults that are not that your wisedome
From one that so imperfectly conceits
Would take no notice nor build your selfe a trouble
Out of his scattering and vnsure obseruance
It were not for your quiet nor your good
Nor for my Manhood Honesty and Wisedome
To let you know my thoughts

   Oth What dost thou meane
  Iago Good name in Man  woman deere my Lord
Is the immediate Iewell of their Soules
Who steales my purse steales trash
Tis something nothing
Twas mine tis his and has bin slaue to thousands
But he that filches from me my good Name
Robs me of that which not enriches him
And makes me poore indeed

   Oth Ile know thy Thoughts

   Iago You cannot if my heart were in your hand
Nor shall not whilst tis in my custodie

   Oth Ha
  Iago Oh beware my Lord of iealousie
It is the greeneeyd Monster which doth mocke
The meate it feeds on That Cuckold liues in blisse
Who certaine of his Fate loues not his wronger
But oh what damned minutes tels he ore
Who dotes yet doubts Suspects yet soundly loues
  Oth O miserie

   Iago Poore and Content is rich and rich enough
But Riches finelesse is as poore as Winter
To him that euer feares he shall be poore
Good Heauen the Soules of all my Tribe defend
From Iealousie

   Oth Why why is this
Thinkst thou Ild make a Life of Iealousie
To follow still the changes of the Moone
With fresh suspitions No to be once in doubt
Is to be resolud Exchange me for a Goat
When I shall turne the businesse of my Soule
To such exufflicate and blowd Surmises
Matching thy inference Tis not to make me Iealious
To say my wife is faire feeds well loues company
Is free of Speech Sings Playes and Dances
Where Vertue is these are more vertuous
Nor from mine owne weake merites will I draw
The smallest feare or doubt of her reuolt
For she had eyes and chose me No Iago
Ile see before I doubt when I doubt proue
And on the proofe there is no more but this
Away at once with Loue or Iealousie

   Ia I am glad of this For now I shall haue reason
To shew the Loue and Duty that I beare you
With franker spirit Therefore as I am bound
Receiue it from me I speake not yet of proofe
Looke to your wife obserue her well with Cassio
Weare your eyes thus not Iealious nor Secure
I would not haue your free and Noble Nature
Out of selfeBounty be abusd Looke toot
I know our Country disposition well
In Venice they do let Heauen see the prankes
They dare not shew their Husbands
Their best Conscience
Is not to leauet vndone but kept vnknowne

   Oth Dost thou say so
  Iago She did deceiue her Father marrying you
And when she seemd to shake and feare your lookes
She loud them most

   Oth And so she did

   Iago Why go too then
Shee that so young could giue out such a Seeming
To seele her Fathers eyes vp close as Oake
He thought twas Witchcraft
But I am much too blame
I humbly do beseech you of your pardon
For too much louing you

   Oth I am bound to thee for euer

   Iago I see this hath a little dashd your Spirits
  Oth Not a iot not a iot

   Iago Trust me I feare it has
I hope you will consider what is spoke
Comes from your Loue
But I do see yare mooud
I am to pray you not to straine my speech
To grosser issues nor to larger reach
Then to Suspition

   Oth I will not

   Iago Should you do so my Lord
My speech should fall into such vilde successe
Which my Thoughts aymd not
Cassios my worthy Friend
My Lord I see yare moud

   Oth No not much moud
I do not thinke but Desdemonas honest

   Iago Long liue she so
And long liue you to thinke so

   Oth And yet how Nature erring from it selfe

   Iago I theres the point
As to be bold with you
Not to affect many proposed Matches
Of her owne Clime Complexion and Degree
Whereto we see in all things Nature tends
Foh one may smel in such a will most ranke
Foule disproportions Thoughts vnnaturall
But pardon me I do not in position
Distinctly speake of her though I may feare
Her will recoyling to her better iudgement
May fal to match you with her Country formes
And happily repent

   Oth Farewell farewell
If more thou dost perceiue let me know more
Set on thy wife to obserue
Leaue me Iago

   Iago My Lord I take my leaue

This honest Creature doubtlesse
Sees and knowes more much more then he vnfolds

   Iago My Lord I would I might intreat your Honor
To scan this thing no farther Leaue it to time
Although tis fit that Cassio haue his Place
For sure he filles it vp with great Ability
Yet if you please to him off awhile
You shall by that perceiue him and his meanes
Note if your Lady straine his Entertainment
With any strong or vehement importunitie
Much will be seene in that In the meane time
Let me be thought too busie in my feares
As worthy cause I haue to feare I am
And hold her free I do beseech your Honor

  Oth This Fellows of exceeding honesty
And knowes all Quantities with a learnd Spirit
Of humane dealings If I do proue her Haggard
Though that her Iesses were my deere heartstrings
Ild whistle her off and let her downe the winde
To prey at Fortune Haply for I am blacke
And haue not those soft parts of Conuersation
That Chamberers haue Or for I am declind
Into the vale of yeares yet thats not much
Shees gone I am abusd and my releefe
Must be to loath her Oh Curse of Marriage
That we can call these delicate Creatures ours
And not their Appetites I had rather be a Toad
And liue vpon the vapour of a Dungeon
Then keepe a corner in the thing I loue
For others vses Yet tis the plague to Greatones
Prerogatiud are they lesse then the Base
Tis destiny vnshunnable like death
Euen then this forked plague is Fated to vs

This was her first remembrance from the Moore
My wayward Husband hath a hundred times
Wood me to steale it But she so loues the Token

To kisse and talke too Ile haue the worke tane out

Exit aemil

I will in Cassios Lodging loose this Napkin
And let him finde it Trifles light as ayre
Are to the iealious confirmations strong
As proofes of holy Writ This may do something
The Moore already changes with my poyson
Dangerous conceites are in their Natures poysons
Which at the first are scarse found to distaste
But with a little acte vpon the blood
Burne like the Mines of Sulphure I did say so
Enter Othello

Looke where he comes Not Poppy nor Mandragora
Nor all the drowsie Syrrups of the world
Shall euer medicine thee to that sweete sleepe
Which thou owdst yesterday

   Iago How now my Lord
  Oth What sense had I in her stolne houres of Lust
I sawt not thought it not it harmd not me
I slept the next night well fed well was free and merrie
I found not Cassios kisses on her Lippes
He that is robbd not wanting what is stolne
Let him not knowt and hes not robbd at all

   Iago I am sorry to heare this
  Oth I had beene happy if the generall Campe
Pyoners and all had tasted her sweet Body
So I had nothing knowne Oh now for euer
Farewell the Tranquill minde farewell Content
Farewell the plumed Troopes and the bigge Warres
That makes Ambition Vertue Oh farewell
Farewell the neighing Steed and the shrill Trumpe
The Spiritstirring Drum th Earepiercing Fife
The Royall Banner and all Qualitie
Pride Pompe and Circumstance of glorious Warre
And O you mortall Engines whose rude throates
Th immortall Ioues dread Clamours counterfet
Farewell Othellos Occupations gone

   Iago Ist possible my Lord
  Oth Villaine be sure thou proue my Loue a Whore
Be sure of it Giue me the Occular proofe

  Oth Make me to seet or at the least so proue it
That the probation beare no Hindge nor Loope
To hang a doubt on Or woe vpon thy life

   Iago My Noble Lord

   Oth If thou dost slander her and torture me
Neuer pray more Abandon all remorse
On Horrors head Horrors accumulate
Do deeds to make Heauen weepe all Earth amazd
For nothing canst thou to damnation adde
Greater then that

   Iago O Grace O Heauen forgiue me
Are you a Man Haue you a Soule or Sense
God buy you take mine Office Oh wretched Foole
That loust to make thine Honesty a Vice
Oh monstrous world Take note take note O World
To be direct and honest is not safe
I thanke you for this profit and from hence
Ile loue no Friend sith Loue breeds such offence

   Oth Nay stay thou shouldst be honest

   Iago I should be wise for Honesties a Foole
And looses that it workes for

   Oth By the World
I thinke my Wife be honest and thinke she is not
I thinke that thou art iust and thinke thou art not
Ile haue some proofe My name that was as fresh
As Dians Visage is now begrimd and blacke
As mine owne face If there be Cords or Kniues
Poyson or Fire or suffocating streames
Ile not indure it Would I were satisfied

   Iago I see you are eaten vp with Passion
I do repent me that I put it to you
You would be satisfied
  Oth Would Nay and I will

   Iago And may but how How satisfied my Lord
Would you the supervision grossely gape on
Behold her topd
  Oth Death and damnation Oh
  Iago It were a tedious difficulty I thinke
To bring them to that Prospect Damne them then
If euer mortall eyes do see them boulster
More then their owne What then How then
What shall I say Wheres Satisfaction
It is impossible you should see this
Were they as prime as Goates as hot as Monkeyes
As salt as Wolues in pride and Fooles as grosse
As Ignorance made drunke But yet I say
If imputation and strong circumstances
Which leade directly to the doore of Truth
Will giue you satisfaction you might hauet

   Oth Giue me a liuing reason shes disloyall

   Iago I do not like the Office
But sith I am entred in this cause so farre
Prickd toot by foolish Honesty and Loue
I will go on I lay with Cassio lately
And being troubled with a raging tooth
I could not sleepe There are a kinde of men
So loose of Soule that in their sleepes will mutter
Their Affayres one of this kinde is Cassio
In sleepe I heard him say sweet Desdemona
Let vs be wary let vs hide our Loues
And then Sir would he gripe and wring my hand
Cry oh sweet Creature then kisse me hard
As if he pluckt vp kisses by the rootes
That grew vpon my lippes laid his Leg ore my Thigh
And sigh and kisse and then cry cursed Fate
That gaue thee to the Moore

   Oth O monstrous monstrous
  Iago Nay this was but his Dreame

   Oth But this denoted a foregone conclusion
Tis a shrewd doubt though it be but a Dreame

   Iago And this may helpe to thicken other proofes
That do demonstrate thinly

   Oth Ile teare her all to peeces

   Iago Nay yet be wise yet we see nothing done
She may be honest yet Tell me but this
Haue you not sometimes seene a Handkerchiefe
Spotted with Strawberries in your wiues hand
  Oth I gaue her such a one twas my first gift

   Iago I know not that but such a Handkerchiefe
I am sure it was your wiues did I to day
See Cassio wipe his Beard with

   Oth If it be that

   Iago If it be that or any it was here
It speakes against her with the other proofes

   Othel O that the Slaue had forty thousand liues
One is too poore too weake for my reuenge
Now do I see tis true Looke heere Iago
All my fond loue thus do I blow to Heauen Tis gone
Arise blacke vengeance from the hollow hell
Yeeld vp O Loue thy Crowne and hearted Throne
To tyrannous Hate Swell bosome with thy fraught
For tis of Aspickes tongues

To the Proponticke and the Hellespont
Euen so my bloody thoughts with violent pace
Shall neur looke backe neur ebbe to humble Loue
Till that a capeable and wide Reuenge
Swallow them vp Now by yond Marble Heauen
In the due reuerence of a Sacred vow
I heere engage my words

   Iago Do not rise yet
Witnesse you euerburning Lights aboue
You Elements that clip vs round about
Witnesse that heere Iago doth giue vp
The execution of his wit hands heart
To wrongd Othellos Seruice Let him command
And to obey shall be in me remorse
What bloody businesse euer

   Oth I greet thy loue
Not with vaine thanks but with acceptance bounteous
And will vpon the instant put thee toot
Within these three dayes let me heare thee say
That Cassios not aliue

   Oth Not
  Des No indeed my Lord

   Oth Thats a fault That Handkerchiefe
Did an aegyptian to my Mother giue
She was a Charmer and could almost read
The thoughts of people She told her while she kept it
T would make her Amiable and subdue my Father
Intirely to her loue But if she lost it
Or made a Guift of it my Fathers eye
Should hold her loathed and his Spirits should hunt
After new Fancies She dying gaue it me
And bid me when my Fate would haue me Wiud
To giue it her I did so and take heede ont
Make it a Darling like your precious eye
To looset or giuet away were such perdition
As nothing else could match

   Des Ist possible
  Oth Tis true Theres Magicke in the web of it
A Sybill that had numbred in the world
The Sun to course two hundred compasses
In her Prophetticke furie sowd the Worke
The Wormes were hallowed that did breede the Silke
And it was dyde in Mummey which the Skilfull
Conserud of Maidens hearts

  Cassio Madam my former suite I do beseech you
That by your vertuous meanes I may againe
Exist and be a member of his loue
Whom I with all the Office of my heart
Intirely honour I would not be delayd
If my offence be of such mortall kinde
That nor my Seruice past nor present Sorrowes
Nor purposd merit in futurity
Can ransome me into his loue againe
But to know so must be my benefit
So shall I cloath me in a forcd content
And shut my selfe vp in some other course
To Fortunes Almes

   Des Alas thricegentle Cassio
My Aduocation is not now in Tune
My Lord is not my Lord nor should I know him
Were he in Fauour as in Humour alterd
So helpe me euery spirit sanctified
As I haue spoken for you all my best
And stood within the blanke of his displeasure
For my free speech You must awhile be patient
What I can do I will and more I will
Then for my selfe I dare Let that suffice you

   Iago Is my Lord angry
Aemil He went hence but now
And certainly in strange vnquietnesse

   Iago Can he be angry I haue seen the Cannon
When it hath blowne his Rankes into the Ayre
And like the Diuell from his very Arme
Pufft his owne Brother And is he angry
Something of moment then I will go meet him
Theres matter int indeed if he be angry

Exit

  Des I prythee do so Something sure of State
Either from Venice or some vnhatchd practise
Made demonstrable heere in Cyprus to him
Hath pudled his cleare Spirit and in such cases
Mens Natures wrangle with inferiour things
Though great ones are their obiect Tis euen so
For let our finger ake and it endues
Our other healthfull members euen to a sense
Of paine Nay we must thinke men are not Gods
Nor of them looke for such obseruancie
As fits the Bridall Beshrew me much aemilia

Arraigning his vnkindnesse with my soule
But now I finde I had subornd the Witnesse

State matters as you thinke and no Conception
Nor no Iealious Toy concerning you

   Des Alas the day I neuer gaue him cause
Aemil But Iealious soules will not be answerd so
They are not euer iealious for the cause
But iealious for theyre iealious It is a Monster
Begot vpon it selfe borne on it selfe

The which he promisd Do but encaue your selfe
And marke the Fleeres the Gybes and notable Scornes

A Huswife that by selling her desires
Buyes her selfe Bread and Cloath It is a Creature

To beguile many and be beguild by one
He when he heares of her cannot restraine
From the excesse of Laughter Heere he comes
Enter Cassio

And powre our Treasures into forraigne laps
Or else breake out in peeuish Iealousies
Throwing restraint vpon vs Or say they strike vs
Or scant our former hauing in despight
Why we haue galles and though we haue some Grace
Yet haue we some Reuenge Let Husbands know
Their wiues haue sense like them They see and smell
And haue their Palats both for sweet and sowre
As Husbands haue What is it that they do
When they change vs for others Is it Sport
I thinke it is and doth Affection breed it
I thinke it doth Ist Frailty that thus erres
It is so too And haue not we Affections
Desires for Sport and Frailty as men haue
Then let them vse vs well else let them know
The illes we do their illes instruct vs so

Not to picke bad from bad but by bad mend
