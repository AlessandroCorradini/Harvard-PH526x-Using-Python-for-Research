Actus primus

Enter Anthonio Salarino and Salanio

  Anthonio In sooth I know not why I am so sad
It wearies me you say it wearies you
But how I caught it found it or came by it
What stuffe tis made of whereof it is borne
I am to learne and such a Wantwit sadnesse makes of
mee
That I haue much ado to know my selfe

   Sal Your minde is tossing on the Ocean
There where your Argosies with portly saile
Like Signiors and rich Burgers on the flood
Or as it were the Pageants of the sea
Do ouerpeere the pettie Traffiquers
That curtsie to them do them reuerence
As they flye by them with their wouen wings

   Salar Beleeue me sir had I such venture forth
The better part of my affections would
Be with my hopes abroad I should be still
Plucking the grasse to know where sits the winde
Peering in Maps for ports and peers and rodes
And euery obiect that might make me feare
Misfortune to my ventures out of doubt
Would make me sad

   Sal My winde cooling my broth
Would blow me to an Ague when I thought
What harme a winde too great might doe at sea
I should not see the sandie houreglasse runne
But I should thinke of shallows and of flats
And see my wealthy Andrew docks in sand
Vailing her high top lower then her ribs
To kisse her buriall should I goe to Church
And see the holy edifice of stone
And not bethinke me straight of dangerous rocks
Which touching but my gentle Vessels side
Would scatter all her spices on the streame
Enrobe the roring waters with my silkes
And in a word but euen now worth this
And now worth nothing Shall I haue the thought
To thinke on this and shall I lacke the thought
That such a thing bechauncd would make me sad
But tell me I know Anthonio
Is sad to thinke vpon his merchandize

   Anth Beleeue me no I thanke my fortune for it
My ventures are not in one bottome trusted
Nor to one place nor is my whole estate
Vpon the fortune of this present yeere
Therefore my merchandize makes me not sad

   Sola Why then you are in loue

   Anth Fie fie

   Sola Not in loue neither then let vs say you are sad
Because you are not merry and twere as easie
For you to laugh and leape and say you are merry
Because you are not sad Now by twoheaded Ianus
Nature hath framd strange fellowes in her time
Some that will euermore peepe through their eyes
And laugh like Parrats at a bagpiper
And other of such vineger aspect
That theyll not shew their teeth in way of smile
Though Nestor sweare the iest be laughable
Enter Bassanio Lorenso and Gratiano

  Sola Heere comes Bassanio
Your most noble Kinsman
Gratiano and Lorenso Faryewell
We leaue you now with better company

   Sala I would haue staid till I had made you merry
If worthier friends had not preuented me

   Ant Your worth is very deere in my regard
I take it your owne busines calls on you
And you embrace th occasion to depart

   Sal Good morrow my good Lords

   Bass Good signiors both when shall we laugh say when
You grow exceeding strange must it be so
  Sal Weell make our leysures to attend on yours

Exeunt Salarino and Solanio

  Lor My Lord Bassanio since you haue found Anthonio
We two will leaue you but at dinner time
I pray you haue in minde where we must meete

   Bass I will not faile you

   Grat You looke not well signior Anthonio
You haue too much respect vpon the world
They loose it that doe buy it with much care
Beleeue me you are maruellously changd

   Ant I hold the world but as the world Gratiano
A stage where euery man must play a part
And mine a sad one

   Grati Let me play the foole
With mirth and laughter let old wrinckles come
And let my Liuer rather heate with wine
Then my heart coole with mortifying grones
Why should a man whose bloud is warme within
Sit like his Grandsire cut in Alablaster
Sleepe when he wakes and creep into the Iaundies
By being peeuish I tell thee what Anthonio
I loue thee and it is my loue that speakes
There are a sort of men whose visages
Do creame and mantle like a standing pond
And do a wilfull stilnesse entertaine
With purpose to be drest in an opinion
Of wisedome grauity profound conceit
As who should say I am sir an Oracle
And when I ope my lips let no dogge barke
O my Anthonio I do know of these
That therefore onely are reputed wise
For saying nothing when I am verie sure
If they should speake would almost dam those eares
Which hearing them would call their brothers fooles
Ile tell thee more of this another time
But fish not with this melancholly baite
For this foole Gudgin this opinion
Come good Lorenzo faryewell a while
Ile end my exhortation after dinner

   Lor Well we will leaue you then till dinner time
I must be one of these same dumbe wise men
For Gratiano neuer lets me speake

   Gra Well keepe me company but two yeares mo
Thou shalt not know the sound of thine owne tongue

   Ant Far you well Ile grow a talker for this geare

   Gra Thankes ifaith for silence is onely commendable
In a neats tongue drid and a maid not vendible
Enter

  Ant It is that any thing now

   Bas Gratiano speakes an infinite deale of nothing
more then any man in all Venice his reasons are two
graines of wheate hid in two bushels of chaffe you shall
seeke all day ere you finde them  when you haue them
they are not worth the search

   An Well tel me now what Lady is the same
To whom you swore a secret Pilgrimage
That you to day promisd to tel me of
  Bas Tis not vnknowne to you Anthonio
How much I haue disabled mine estate
By something shewing a more swelling port
Then my faint meanes would grant continuance
Nor do I now make mone to be abridgd
From such a noble rate but my cheefe care
Is to come fairely off from the great debts
Wherein my time something too prodigall
Hath left me gagd to you Anthonio
I owe the most in money and in loue
And from your loue I haue a warrantie
To vnburthen all my plots and purposes
How to get cleere of all the debts I owe

   An I pray you good Bassanio let me know it
And if it stand as you your selfe still do
Within the eye of honour be assurd
My purse my person my extreamest meanes
Lye all vnlockd to your occasions

   Bass In my schoole dayes when I had lost one shaft
I shot his fellow of the selfesame flight
The selfesame way with more aduised watch
To finde the other forth and by aduenturing both
I oft found both I vrge this childhoode proofe
Because what followes is pure innocence
I owe you much and like a wilfull youth
That which I owe is lost but if you please
To shoote another arrow that selfe way
Which you did shoot the first I do not doubt
As I will watch the ayme Or to finde both
Or bring your latter hazard backe againe
And thankfully rest debter for the first

   An You know me well and herein spend but time
To winde about my loue with circumstance
And out of doubt you doe more wrong
In making question of my vttermost
Then if you had made waste of all I haue
Then doe but say to me what I should doe
That in your knowledge may by me be done
And I am prest vnto it therefore speake

   Bass In Belmont is a Lady richly left
And she is faire and fairer then that word
Of wondrous vertues sometimes from her eyes
I did receiue faire speechlesse messages
Her name is Portia nothing vndervallewd
To Catos daughter Brutus Portia
Nor is the wide world ignorant of her worth
For the four windes blow in from euery coast
Renowned sutors and her sunny locks
Hang on her temples like a golden fleece
Which makes her seat of Belmont Cholchos strond
And many Iasons come in quest of her
O my Anthonio had I but the meanes
To hold a riuall place with one of them
I haue a minde presages me such thrift
That I should questionlesse be fortunate

   Anth Thou knowst that all my fortunes are at sea
Neither haue I money nor commodity
To raise a present summe therefore goe forth
Try what my credit can in Venice doe
That shall be rackt euen to the vttermost
To furnish thee to Belmont to faire Portia
Goe presently enquire and so will I
Where money is and I no question make
To haue it of my trust or for my sake

Exeunt

Enter Portia with her waiting woman Nerissa

  Portia By my troth Nerrissa my little body is a wearie
of this great world

   Ner You would be sweet Madam if your miseries
were in the same abundance as your good fortunes are
and yet for ought I see they are as sicke that surfet with
too much as they that starue with nothing it is no smal
happinesse therefore to bee seated in the meane superfluitie
comes sooner by white haires but competencie
liues longer

   Portia Good sentences and well pronouncd

   Ner They would be better if well followed

   Portia If to doe were as easie as to know what were
good to doe Chappels had beene Churches and poore
mens cottages Princes Pallaces it is a good Diuine that
followes his owne instructions I can easier teach twentie
what were good to be done then be one of the twentie
to follow mine owne teaching the braine may deuise
lawes for the blood but a hot temper leapes ore a
colde decree such a hare is madnesse the youth to skip
ore the meshes of good counsaile the cripple but this
reason is not in fashion to choose me a husband O mee
the word choose I may neither choose whom I would
nor refuse whom I dislike so is the wil of a liuing daughter
curbd by the will of a dead father it is not hard Nerrissa
that I cannot choose one nor refuse none

   Ner Your father was euer vertuous and holy men
at their death haue good inspirations therefore the lotterie
that hee hath deuised in these three chests of gold
siluer and leade whereof who chooses his meaning
chooses you wil no doubt neuer be chosen by any rightly
but one who you shall rightly loue but what warmth
is there in your affection towards any of these Princely
suters that are already come
  Por I pray thee ouername them and as thou namest
them I will describe them and according to my description
leuell at my affection

   Ner First there is the Neopolitane Prince

   Por I thats a colt indeede for he doth nothing but
talke of his horse and hee makes it a great appropriation
to his owne good parts that he can shoo him himselfe
I am much afraid my Ladie his mother plaid false
with a Smyth

   Ner Than is there the Countie Palentine

   Por He doth nothing but frowne as who should
say and you will not haue me choose he heares merrie
tales and smiles not I feare hee will proue the weeping
Phylosopher when he growes old being so full of vnmannerly
sadnesse in his youth I had rather to be married
to a deaths head with a bone in his mouth then to either
of these God defend me from these two

   Ner How say you by the French Lord Mounsier
Le Boune
  Por God made him and therefore let him passe for a
man in truth I know it is a sinne to be a mocker but he
why he hath a horse better then the Neopolitans a better
bad habite of frowning then the Count Palentine he
is euery man in no man if a Trassell sing he fals straight
a capring he will fence with his owne shadow If I should
marry him I should marry twentie husbands if hee
would despise me I would forgiue him for if he loue me
to madnesse I should neuer requite him

   Ner What say you then to Fauconbridge the yong
Baron of England
  Por You know I say nothing to him for hee vnderstands
not me nor I him he hath neither Latine French
nor Italian and you will come into the Court  sweare
that I haue a poore pennieworth in the English hee is a
proper mans picture but alas who can conuerse with a
dumbe show how odly he is suited I thinke he bought
his doublet in Italie his round hose in France his bonnet
in Germanie and his behauiour euery where

   Ner What thinke you of the other Lord his neighbour
  Por That he hath a neighbourly charitie in him for
he borrowed a boxe of the eare of the Englishman and
swore he would pay him againe when hee was able I
thinke the Frenchman became his suretie and seald vnder
for another

   Ner How like you the yong Germaine the Duke of
Saxonies Nephew
  Por Very vildely in the morning when hee is sober
and most vildely in the afternoone when hee is drunke
when he is best he is a little worse then a man and when
he is worst he is little better then a beast and the worst
fall that euer fell I hope I shall make shift to go without
him

   Ner If he should offer to choose and choose the right
Casket you should refuse to performe your Fathers will
if you should refuse to accept him

   Por Therefore for feare of the worst I pray thee set
a deepe glasse of Reinishwine on the contrary Casket
for if the diuell be within and that temptation without
I know he will choose it I will doe any thing Nerrissa
ere I will be married to a spunge

   Ner You neede not feare Lady the hauing any of
these Lords they haue acquainted me with their determinations
which is indeede to returne to their home
and to trouble you with no more suite vnlesse you may
be won by some other sort then your Fathers imposition
depending on the Caskets

   Por If I liue to be as olde as Sibilla I will dye as
chaste as Diana vnlesse I be obtained by the manner
of my Fathers will I am glad this parcell of wooers
are so reasonable for there is not one among them but
I doate on his verie absence and I wish them a faire departure

   Ner Doe you not remember Ladie in your Fathers
time a Venecian a Scholler and a Souldior that
came hither in companie of the Marquesse of Mountferrat
  Por Yes yes it was Bassanio as I thinke so was hee
calld

   Ner True Madam hee of all the men that euer my
foolish eyes lookd vpon was the best deseruing a faire
Lady

   Por I remember him well and I remember him worthy
of thy praise
Enter a Seruingman

  Ser The four Strangers seeke you Madam to take
their leaue and there is a forerunner come from a fift
the Prince of Moroco who brings word the Prince his
Maister will be here to night

   Por If I could bid the fift welcome with so good
heart as I can bid the other foure farewell I should be
glad of his approach if he haue the condition of a Saint
and the complexion of a diuell I had rather hee should
shriue me then wiue me Come Nerrissa sirra go before
whiles wee shut the gate vpon one wooer another
knocks at the doore

Exeunt

Enter Bassanio with Shylocke the Iew

  Shy Three thousand ducates well

   Bass I sir for three months

   Shy For three months well

   Bass For the which as I told you

   Shy Anthonio shall become bound well

   Bass May you sted me Will you pleasure me
Shall I know your answere

   Shy Three thousand ducats for three months
and Anthonio bound

   Bass Your answere to that

   Shy Anthonio is a good man

   Bass Haue you heard any imputation to the contrary

   Shy Ho no no no no my meaning in saying he is a
good man is to haue you vnderstand me that he is sufficient
yet his meanes are in supposition he hath an Argosie
bound to Tripolis another to the Indies I vnderstand
moreouer vpon the Ryalta he hath a third at Mexico
a fourth for England and other ventures hee hath
squandred abroad but ships are but boords Saylers but
men there be land rats and water rats water theeues
and land theeues I meane Pyrats and then there is the
perrill of waters windes and rocks the man is not withstanding
sufficient three thousand ducats I thinke I may
take his bond

   Bas Be assured you may

   Iew I will be assured I may and that I may be assured
I will bethinke mee may I speake with Anthonio
  Bass If it please you to dine with vs

   Iew Yes to smell porke to eate of the habitation

What newes on the Ryalta who is he comes here
Enter Anthonio

  Bass This is signior Anthonio

   Iew How like a fawning publican he lookes
I hate him for he is a Christian
But more for that in low simplicitie
He lends out money gratis and brings downe
The rate of vsance here with vs in Venice
If I can catch him once vpon the hip
I will feede fat the ancient grudge I beare him
He hates our sacred Nation and he railes
Euen there where Merchants most doe congregate
On me my bargaines and my wellworne thrift
Which he cals interrest Cursed by my Trybe
If I forgiue him

   Bass Shylock doe you heare

   Shy I am debating of my present store
And by the neere gesse of my memorie
I cannot instantly raise vp the grosse
Of full three thousand ducats what of that
Tuball a wealthy Hebrew of my Tribe
Will furnish me but soft how many months
Doe you desire Rest you faire good signior
Your worship was the last man in our mouthes

   Ant Shylocke albeit I neither lend nor borrow
By taking nor by giuing of excesse
Yet to supply the ripe wants of my friend
Ile breake a custome is he yet possest
How much he would
  Shy I I three thousand ducats

   Ant And for three months

   Shy I had forgot three months you told me so
Well then your bond and let me see but heare you
Me thoughts you said you neither lend nor borrow
Vpon aduantage

   Ant I doe neuer vse it

   Shy When Iacob grazd his vncle Labans sheepe
This Iacob from our holy Abram was
As his wise mother wrought in his behalfe
The third possesser I he was the third

   Ant And what of him did he take interrest
  Shy No not take interest not as you would say
Directly interest marke what Iacob did
When Laban and himselfe were compremyzd
That all the eanelings which were streakt and pied
Should fall as Iacobs hier the Ewes being rancke
In end of Autumne turned to the Rammes
And when the worke of generation was
Betweene these woolly breeders in the act
The skilfull shepheard pild me certaine wands
And in the dooing of the deede of kinde
He stucke them vp before the fulsome Ewes
Who then conceauing did in eaning time
Fall partycolourd lambs and those were Iacobs
This was a way to thriue and he was blest
And thrift is blessing if men steale it not

   Ant This was a venture sir that Iacob serud for
A thing not in his power to bring to passe
But swayd and fashiond by the hand of heauen
Was this inserted to make interrest good
Or is your gold and siluer Ewes and Rams
  Shy I cannot tell I make it breede as fast
But note me signior

   Ant Marke you this Bassanio
The diuell can cite Scripture for his purpose
An euill soule producing holy witnesse
Is like a villaine with a smiling cheeke
A goodly apple rotten at the heart
O what a goodly outside falsehood hath

   Shy Three thousand ducats tis a good round sum
Three months from twelue then let me see the rate

   Ant Well Shylocke shall we be beholding to you
  Shy Signior Anthonio many a time and oft
In the Ryalto you haue rated me
About my monies and my vsances
Still haue I borne it with a patient shrug
For suffrance is the badge of all our Tribe
You call me misbeleeuer cutthroate dog
And spet vpon my Iewish gaberdine
And all for vse of that which is mine owne
Well then it now appeares you neede my helpe
Goe to then you come to me and you say
Shylocke we would haue moneyes you say so
You that did voide your rume vpon my beard
And foote me as you spurne a stranger curre
Ouer your threshold moneyes is your suite
What should I say to you Should I not say
Hath a dog money Is it possible
A curre should lend three thousand ducats or
Shall I bend low and in a bondmans key
With bated breath and whispring humblenesse
Say this Faire sir you spet on me on Wednesday last
You spurnd me such a day another time
You cald me dog and for these curtesies
Ile lend you thus much moneyes

   Ant I am as like to call thee so againe
To spet on thee againe to spurne thee too
If thou wilt lend this money lend it not
As to thy friends for when did friendship take
A breede of barraine mettall of his friend
But lend it rather to thine enemie
Who if he breake thou maist with better face
Exact the penalties

   Shy Why looke you how you storme
I would be friends with you and haue your loue
Forget the shames that you haue staind me with
Supplie your present wants and take no doite
Of vsance for my moneyes and youle not heare me
This is kinde I offer

   Bass This were kindnesse

   Shy This kindnesse will I showe
Goe with me to a Notarie seale me there
Your single bond and in a merrie sport
If you repaie me not on such a day
In such a place such sum or sums as are
Exprest in the condition let the forfeite
Be nominated for an equall pound
Of your faire flesh to be cut off and taken
In what part of your bodie it pleaseth me

   Ant Content infaith Ile seale to such a bond
And say there is much kindnesse in the Iew

   Bass You shall not seale to such a bond for me
Ile rather dwell in my necessitie

   Ant Why feare not man I will not forfaite it
Within these two months thats a month before
This bond expires I doe expect returne
Of thrice three times the valew of this bond

   Shy O father Abram what these Christians are
Whose owne hard dealings teaches them suspect
The thoughts of others Praie you tell me this
If he should breake his daie what should I gaine
By the exaction of the forfeiture
A pound of mans flesh taken from a man
Is not so estimable profitable neither
As flesh of Muttons Beefes or Goates I say
To buy his fauour I extend this friendship
If he will take it so if not adiew
And for my loue I praie you wrong me not

   Ant Yes Shylocke I will seale vnto this bond

   Shy Then meete me forthwith at the Notaries
Giue him direction for this merrie bond
And I will goe and purse the ducats straite
See to my house left in the fearefull gard
Of an vnthriftie knaue and presentlie
Ile be with you
Enter

  Ant Hie thee gentle Iew This Hebrew will turne
Christian he growes kinde

   Bass I like not faire tearmes and a villaines minde

  Mor Mislike me not for my complexion
The shadowed liuerie of the burnisht sunne
To whom I am a neighbour and neere bred
Bring me the fairest creature Northward borne
Where Phoebus fire scarce thawes the ysicles

Therefore I pray you leade me to the Caskets
To trie my fortune By this Symitare
That slew the Sophie and a Persian Prince
That won three fields of Sultan Solyman
I would orestare the sternest eies that looke
Outbraue the heart most daring on the earth
Plucke the yong sucking Cubs from the she Beare
Yea mocke the Lion when he rores for pray
To win the Ladie But alas the while
If Hercules and Lychas plaie at dice
Which is the better man the greater throw
May turne by fortune from the weaker hand
So is Alcides beaten by his rage
And so may I blinde fortune leading me
Misse that which one vnworthier may attaine
And die with grieuing

And either not attempt to choose at all
Or sweare before you choose if you choose wrong
Neuer to speake to Ladie afterward
In way of marriage therefore be aduisd

With that keene appetite that he sits downe
Where is the horse that doth vntread againe
His tedious measures with the vnbated fire
That he did pace them first all things that are
Are with more spirit chased then enioyd
How like a yonger or a prodigall
The skarfed barke puts from her natiue bay
Hudgd and embraced by the strumpet winde

   Ies Heere catch this casket it is worth the paines
I am glad tis night you do not looke on me
For I am much ashamd of my exchange
But loue is blinde and louers cannot see
The pretty follies that themselues commit
For if they could Cupid himselfe would blush
To see me thus transformed to a boy

   Lor Descend for you must be my torchbearer

   Ies What must I hold a Candle to my shames
They in themselues goodsooth are too too light

Who chooseth me shall gaine what men desire
The second siluer which this promise carries
Who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserues
This third dull lead with warning all as blunt
Who chooseth me must giue and hazard all he hath
How shall I know if I doe choose the right
How shall I know if I doe choose the right

   Por The one of them containes my picture Prince
If you choose that then I am yours withall

   Mor Some God direct my iudgement let me see
I will suruay the inscriptions backe againe
What saies this leaden casket
Who chooseth me must giue and hazard all he hath
Must giue for what for lead hazard for lead
This casket threatens men that hazard all
Doe it in hope of faire aduantages
A golden minde stoopes not to showes of drosse
Ile then nor giue nor hazard ought for lead
What saies the Siluer with her virgin hue
Who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserues
As much as he deserues pause there Morocho
And weigh thy value with an euen hand
If thou beest rated by thy estimation
Thou doost deserue enough and yet enough
May not extend so farre as to the Ladie
And yet to be afeard of my deseruing
Were but a weake disabling of my selfe
As much as I deserue why thats the Lady
I doe in birth deserue her and in fortunes
In graces and in qualities of breeding
But more then these in loue I doe deserue
What if I straid no farther but chose here
Lets see once more this saying graud in gold
Who chooseth me shall gaine what many men desire
Why thats the Lady all the world desires her
From the foure corners of the earth they come
To kisse this shrine this mortall breathing Saint
The Hircanion deserts and the vaste wildes
Of wide Arabia are as throughfares now
For Princes to come view faire Portia
The waterie Kingdome whose ambitious head
Spets in the face of heauen is no barre
To stop the forraine spirits but they come
As ore a brooke to see faire Portia
One of these three containes her heauenly picture
Ist like that Lead containes her twere damnation
To thinke so base a thought it were too grose
To rib her searecloath in the obscure graue
Or shall I thinke in Siluer shes immurd
Being ten times vndervalued to tride gold
O sinfull thought neuer so rich a Iem
Was set in worse then gold They haue in England
A coyne that beares the figure of an Angell
Stampt in gold but thats insculpt vpon
But here an Angell in a golden bed
Lies all within Deliuer me the key
Here doe I choose and thriue I as I may

Within whose emptie eye there is a written scroule
Ile reade the writing
All that glisters is not gold
Often haue you heard that told
Many a man his life hath sold
But my outside to behold
Guilded timber doe wormes infold
Had you beene as wise as bold
Yong in limbs in iudgement old
Your answere had not beene inscrold
Fareyouwell your suite is cold

But there the Duke was giuen to vnderstand
That in a Gondilo were seene together
Lorenzo and his amorous Iessica
Besides Anthonio certified the Duke
They were not with Bassanio in his ship

   Sol I neuer heard a passion so confusd
So strange outragious and so variable
As the dogge Iew did vtter in the streets
My daughter O my ducats O my daughter
Fled with a Christian O my Christian ducats
Iustice the law my ducats and my daughter
A sealed bag two sealed bags of ducats
Of double ducats stolne from me by my daughter
And iewels two stones two rich and precious stones
Stolne by my daughter iustice finde the girle
She hath the stones vpon her and the ducats

   Sal Why all the boyes in Venice follow him
Crying his stones his daughter and his ducats

   Sol Let good Anthonio looke he keepe his day
Or he shall pay for this

   Sal Marry well remembred
I reasond with a Frenchman yesterday
Who told me in the narrow seas that part
The French and English there miscaried
A vessell of our countrey richly fraught
I thought vpon Anthonio when he told me
And wisht in silence that it were not his

   Sol You were best to tell Anthonio what you heare
Yet doe not suddainely for it may grieue him

   Sal A kinder Gentleman treads not the earth
I saw Bassanio and Anthonio part
Bassanio told him he would make some speede
Of his returne he answered doe not so
Slubber not businesse for my sake Bassanio
But stay the very riping of the time
And for the Iewes bond which he hath of me
Let it not enter in your minde of loue
Be merry and imploy your chiefest thoughts
To courtship and such faire ostents of loue
As shall conueniently become you there
And euen there his eye being big with teares
Turning his face he put his hand behinde him
And with affection wondrous sencible
He wrung Bassanios hand and so they parted

   Sol I thinke he onely loues the world for him
I pray thee let vs goe and finde him out
And quicken his embraced heauinesse
With some delight or other

First neuer to vnfold to any one
Which casket twas I chose next if I faile
Of the right casket neuer in my life
To wooe a maide in way of marriage
Lastly if I doe faile in fortune of my choyse
Immediately to leaue you and be gone

To my hearts hope gold siluer and base lead
Who chooseth me must giue and hazard all he hath
You shall looke fairer ere I giue or hazard
What saies the golden chest ha let me see
Who chooseth me shall gaine what many men desire
What many men desire that many may be meant
By the foole multitude that choose by show
Not learning more then the fond eye doth teach
Which pries not to th interior but like the Martlet
Builds in the weather on the outward wall
Euen in the force and rode of casualtie
I will not choose what many men desire
Because I will not iumpe with common spirits
And ranke me with the barbarous multitudes
Why then to thee thou Siluer treasure house
Tell me once more what title thou doost beare
Who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserues
And well said too for who shall goe about
To cosen Fortune and be honourable
Without the stampe of merrit let none presume
To weare an vndeserued dignitie
O that estates degrees and offices
Were not deriud corruptly and that cleare honour
Were purchast by the merrit of the wearer
How many then should couer that stand bare
How many be commanded that command
How much low pleasantry would then be gleaned
From the true seede of honor And how much honor
Pickt from the chaffe and ruine of the times
To be new varnisht Well but to my choise
Who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserues
I will assume desert giue me a key for this
And instantly vnlocke my fortunes here

Presenting me a scedule I will reade it
How much vnlike art thou to Portia
How much vnlike my hopes and my deseruings
Who chooseth me shall haue as much as he deserues
Did I deserue no more then a fooles head
Is that my prize are my deserts no better
  Por To offend and iudge are distinct offices
And of opposed natures

   Ar What is here
The fier seauen times tried this
Seauen times tried that iudgement is
That did neuer choose amis
Some there be that shadowes kisse
Such haue but a shadowes blisse
There be fooles aliue Iwis
Siluerd ore and so was this
Take what wife you will to bed
I will euer be your head
So be gone you are sped

With one fooles head I came to woo
But I goe away with two
Sweet adue Ile keepe my oath
Patiently to beare my wroath

Exeunt

Enter Bassanio Portia Gratiano and all their traine

  Por I pray you tarrie pause a day or two
Before you hazard for in choosing wrong
I loose your companie therefore forbeare a while
Theres something tels me but it is not loue
I would not loose you and you know your selfe
Hate counsailes not in such a quallitie
But least you should not vnderstand me well
And yet a maiden hath no tongue but thought
I would detaine you here some month or two
Before you venture for me I could teach you
How to choose right but then I am forsworne
So will I neuer be so may you misse me
But if you doe youle make me wish a sinne
That I had beene forsworne Beshrow your eyes
They haue orelookt me and deuided me
One halfe of me is yours the other halfe yours
Mine owne I would say but of mine then yours
And so all yours O these naughtie times
Puts bars betweene the owners and their rights
And so though yours not yours proue it so
Let Fortune goe to hell for it not I
I speake too long but tis to peize the time
To ich it and to draw it out in length
To stay you from election

   Bass Let me choose
For as I am I liue vpon the racke

   Por Vpon the racke Bassanio then confesse
What treason there is mingled with your loue

   Bass None but that vglie treason of mistrust
Which makes me feare the enioying of my loue
There may as well be amitie and life
Tweene snow and fire as treason and my loue

   Por I but I feare you speake vpon the racke
Where men enforced doth speake any thing

   Bass Promise me life and ile confesse the truth

   Por Well then confesse and liue

   Bass Confesse and loue
Had beene the verie sum of my confession
O happie torment when my torturer
Doth teach me answers for deliuerance
But let me to my fortune and the caskets

   Por Away then I am lockt in one of them
If you doe loue me you will finde me out
Nerryssa and the rest stand all aloofe
Let musicke sound while he doth make his choise
Then if he loose he makes a Swanlike end
Fading in musique That the comparison
May stand more proper my eye shall be the streame
And watrie deathbed for him he may win
And what is musique than Than musique is
Euen as the flourish when true subiects bowe
To a new crowned Monarch Such it is
As are those dulcet sounds in breake of day
That creepe into the dreaming bridegroomes eare
And summon him to marriage Now he goes
With no lesse presence but with much more loue
Then yong Alcides when he did redeeme
The virgine tribute paied by howling Troy
To the Seamonster I stand for sacrifice
The rest aloofe are the Dardanian wiues
With bleared visages come forth to view
The issue of th exploit Goe Hercules
Liue thou I liue with much more dismay
I view the sight then thou that makst the fray

Here Musicke A Song the whilst Bassanio comments on the
Caskets to
himselfe

Tell me where is fancie bred
Or in the heart or in the head
How begot how nourished Replie replie
It is engendred in the eyes
With gazing fed and Fancie dies
In the cradle where it lies
Let vs all ring Fancies knell
Ile begin it
Ding dong bell

   All Ding dong bell

   Bass So may the outward showes be least themselues
The world is still deceiud with ornament
In Law what Plea so tainted and corrupt
But being seasond with a gracious voice
Obscures the show of euill In Religion
What damned error but some sober brow
Will blesse it and approue it with a text
Hiding the grosenesse with faire ornament
There is no voice so simple but assumes
Some marke of vertue on his outward parts
How manie cowards whose hearts are all as false
As stayers of sand weare yet vpon their chins
The beards of Hercules and frowning Mars
Who inward searcht haue lyuers white as milke
And these assume but valors excrement
To render them redoubted Looke on beautie
And you shall see tis purchast by the weight
Which therein workes a miracle in nature
Making them lightest that weare most of it
So are those crisped snakie golden locks
Which makes such wanton gambols with the winde
Vpon supposed fairenesse often knowne
To be the dowrie of a second head
The scull that bred them in the Sepulcher
Thus ornament is but the guiled shore
To a most dangerous sea the beautious scarfe
Vailing an Indian beautie In a word
The seeming truth which cunning times put on
To intrap the wisest Therefore then thou gaudie gold
Hard food for Midas I will none of thee
Nor none of thee thou pale and common drudge
Tweene man and man but thou thou meager lead
Which rather threatnest then dost promise ought
Thy palenesse moues me more then eloquence
And here choose I ioy be the consequence

   Por How all the other passions fleet to ayre
As doubtfull thoughts and rash imbracd despaire
And shuddring feare and greeneeyed iealousie
O loue be moderate allay thy extasie
In measure raine thy ioy scant this excesse
I feele too much thy blessing make it lesse
For feare I surfeit

   Bas What finde I here
Faire Portias counterfeit What demie God
Hath come so neere creation moue these eies
Or whether riding on the bals of mine
Seeme they in motion Here are seuerd lips
Parted with suger breath so sweet a barre
Should sunder such sweet friends here in her haires
The Painter plaies the Spider and hath wouen
A golden mesh t intrap the hearts of men
Faster then gnats in cobwebs but her eies
How could he see to doe them hauing made one
Me thinkes it should haue power to steale both his
And leaue it selfe vnfurnisht Yet looke how farre
The substance of my praise doth wrong this shadow
In vnderprising it so farre this shadow
Doth limpe behinde the substance Heres the scroule
The continent and summarie of my fortune
You that choose not by the view
Chance as faire and choose as true
Since this fortune fals to you
Be content and seeke no new
If you be well pleasd with this
And hold your fortune for your blisse
Turne you where your Lady is
And claime her with a louing kisse

   Bass A gentle scroule Faire Lady by your leaue
I come by note to giue and to receiue
Like one of two contending in a prize
That thinks he hath done well in peoples eies
Hearing applause and vniuersall shout
Giddie in spirit still gazing in a doubt
Whether those peales of praise be his or no
So thrice faire Lady stand I euen so
As doubtfull whether what I see be true
Vntill confirmd signd ratified by you

   Por You see my Lord Bassiano where I stand
Such as I am though for my selfe alone
I would not be ambitious in my wish
To wish my selfe much better yet for you
I would be trebled twenty times my selfe
A thousand times more faire ten thousand times
More rich that onely to stand high in your account
I might in vertues beauties liuings friends
Exceed account but the full summe of me
Is sum of nothing which to terme in grosse
Is an vnlessoned girle vnschoold vnpractizd
Happy in this she is not yet so old
But she may learne happier then this
Shee is not bred so dull but she can learne
Happiest of all is that her gentle spirit
Commits it selfe to yours to be directed
As from her Lord her Gouernour her King
My selfe and what is mine to you and yours
Is now conuerted But now I was the Lord
Of this faire mansion master of my seruants
Queene ore my selfe and euen now but now
This house these seruants and this same my selfe
Are yours my Lord I giue them with this ring
Which when you part from loose or giue away
Let it presage the ruine of your loue
And be my vantage to exclaime on you

   Bass Maddam you haue bereft me of all words
Onely my bloud speakes to you in my vaines
And there is such confusion in my powers
As after some oration fairely spoke
By a beloued Prince there doth appeare
Among the buzzing pleased multitude
Where euery something being blent together
Turnes to a wilde of nothing saue of ioy
Exprest and not exprest but when this ring
Parts from this finger then parts life from hence
O then be bold to say Bassanios dead

   Ner My Lord and Lady it is now our time
That haue stood by and seene our wishes prosper
To cry good ioy good ioy my Lord and Lady

   Gra My Lord Bassanio and my gentle Lady
I wish you all the ioy that you can wish
For I am sure you can wish none from me
And when your Honours meane to solemnize
The bargaine of your faith I doe beseech you
Euen at that time I may be married too

   Bass With all my heart so thou canst get a wife

   Gra I thanke your Lordship you haue got me one
My eyes my Lord can looke as swift as yours
You saw the mistres I beheld the maid
You loud I loud for intermission
No more pertaines to me my Lord then you
Your fortune stood vpon the caskets there
And so did mine too as the matter falls
For wooing heere vntill I swet againe
And swearing till my very rough was dry
With oathes of loue at last if promise last
I got a promise of this faire one heere
To haue her loue prouided that your fortune
Atchieud her mistresse

   Por Is this true Nerrissa
  Ner Madam it is so so you stand pleasd withall

   Bass And doe you Gratiano meane good faith
  Gra Yes faith my Lord

   Bass Our feast shall be much honored in your marriage

   Gra Weele play with them the first boy for a thousand
ducats

   Ner What and stake downe
  Gra No we shal nere win at that sport and stake
downe
But who comes heere Lorenzo and his Infidell
What and my old Venetian friend Salerio
Enter Lorenzo Iessica and Salerio

  Bas Lorenzo and Salerio welcome hether
If that the youth of my new interest heere
Haue power to bid you welcome by your leaue
I bid my verie friends and Countrimen
Sweet Portia welcome

   Por So do I my Lord they are intirely welcome

   Lor I thanke your honor for my part my Lord
My purpose was not to haue seene you heere
But meeting with Salerio by the way
He did intreate mee past all saying nay
To come with him along

   Sal I did my Lord
And I haue reason for it Signior Anthonio
Commends him to you

   Bass Ere I ope his Letter
I pray you tell me how my good friend doth

   Sal Not sicke my Lord vnlesse it be in minde
Nor wel vnlesse in minde his Letter there
Wil shew you his estate

Opens the Letter

  Gra Nerrissa cheere yond stranger bid her welcom
Your hand Salerio whats the newes from Venice
How doth that royal Merchant good Anthonio
I know he will be glad of our successe
We are the Iasons we haue won the fleece

   Sal I would you had won the fleece that hee hath
lost

   Por There are some shrewd contents in yond same
Paper
That steales the colour from Bassianos cheeke
Some deere friend dead else nothing in the world
Could turne so much the constitution
Of any constant man What worse and worse
With leaue Bassanio I am halfe your selfe
And I must freely haue the halfe of any thing
That this same paper brings you

   Bass O sweet Portia
Heere are a few of the vnpleasantst words
That euer blotted paper Gentle Ladie
When I did first impart my loue to you
I freely told you all the wealth I had
Ran in my vaines I was a Gentleman
And then I told you true and yet deere Ladie
Rating my selfe at nothing you shall see
How much I was a Braggart when I told you
My state was nothing I should then haue told you
That I was worse then nothing for indeede
I haue ingagd my selfe to a deere friend
Ingagd my friend to his meere enemie
To feede my meanes Heere is a Letter Ladie
The paper as the bodie of my friend
And euerie word in it a gaping wound
Issuing life blood But is it true Salerio
Hath all his ventures faild what not one hit
From Tripolis from Mexico and England
From Lisbon Barbary and India
And not one vessell scape the dreadfull touch
Of Merchantmarring rocks
  Sal Not one my Lord
Besides it should appeare that if he had
The present money to discharge the Iew
He would not take it neuer did I know
A creature that did beare the shape of man
So keene and greedy to confound a man
He plyes the Duke at morning and at night
And doth impeach the freedome of the state
If they deny him iustice Twenty Merchants
The Duke himselfe and the Magnificoes
Of greatest port haue all perswaded with him
But none can driue him from the enuious plea
Of forfeiture of iustice and his bond

   Iessi When I was with him I haue heard him sweare
To Tuball and to Chus his Countrimen
That he would rather haue Anthonios flesh
Then twenty times the value of the summe
That he did owe him and I know my Lord
If law authoritie and power denie not
It will goe hard with poore Anthonio

   Por Is it your deere friend that is thus in trouble
  Bass The deerest friend to me the kindest man
The best conditiond and vnwearied spirit
In doing curtesies and one in whom
The ancient Romane honour more appeares
Then any that drawes breath in Italie

   Por What summe owes he the Iew
  Bass For me three thousand ducats

   Por What no more
Pay him sixe thousand and deface the bond
Double sixe thousand and then treble that
Before a friend of this description
Shall lose a haire through Bassanios fault
First goe with me to Church and call me wife
And then away to Venice to your friend
For neuer shall you lie by Portias side
With an vnquiet soule You shall haue gold
To pay the petty debt twenty times ouer
When it is payd bring your true friend along
My maid Nerrissa and my selfe meane time
Will liue as maids and widdowes come away
For you shall hence vpon your wedding day
Bid your friends welcome show a merry cheere
Since you are deere bought I will loue you deere
But let me heare the letter of your friend
Sweet Bassanio my ships haue all miscarried my Creditors
grow cruell my estate is very low my bond to the Iew is
forfeit and since in paying it it is impossible I should liue all
debts are cleerd between you and I if I might see you at my
death notwithstanding vse your pleasure if your loue doe not
perswade you to come let not my letter

   Por O loue dispach all busines and be gone

   Bass Since I haue your good leaue to goe away
I will make hast but till I come againe
No bed shall ere be guilty of my stay
Nor rest be interposer twixt vs twaine

Exeunt

Enter the Iew and Solanio and Anthonio and the Iaylor

  Iew Iaylor looke to him tell not me of mercy
This is the foole that lends out money gratis
Iaylor looke to him

   Ant Heare me yet good Shylok

   Iew Ile haue my bond speake not against my bond
I haue sworne an oath that I will haue my bond
Thou calldst me dog before thou hadst a cause
But since I am a dog beware my phangs
The Duke shall grant me iustice I do wonder
Thou naughty Iaylor that thou art so fond
To come abroad with him at his request

   Ant I pray thee heare me speake

   Iew Ile haue my bond I will not heare thee speake
Ile haue my bond and therefore speake no more
Ile not be made a soft and dull eyd foole
To shake the head relent and sigh and yeeld
To Christian intercessors follow not
Ile haue no speaking I will haue my bond

Exit Iew

  Sol It is the most impenetrable curre
That euer kept with men

   Ant Let him alone
Ile follow him no more with bootlesse prayers
He seekes my life his reason well I know
I oft deliuerd from his forfeitures
Many that haue at times made mone to me
Therefore he hates me

   Sol I am sure the Duke will neuer grant
this forfeiture to hold

   An The Duke cannot deny the course of law
For the commoditie that strangers haue
With vs in Venice if it be denied
Will much impeach the iustice of the State
Since that the trade and profit of the citty
Consisteth of all Nations Therefore goe
These greefes and losses haue so bated mee
That I shall hardly spare a pound of flesh
To morrow to my bloudy Creditor
Well Iaylor on pray God Bassanio come
To see me pay his debt and then I care not

Exeunt

Enter Portia Nerrissa Lorenzo Iessica and a man of Portias

  Lor Madam although I speake it in your presence
You haue a noble and a true conceit
Of godlike amity which appeares most strongly
In bearing thus the absence of your Lord
But if you knew to whom you shew this honour
How true a Gentleman you send releefe
How deere a louer of my Lord your husband
I know you would be prouder of the worke
Then customary bounty can enforce you

   Por I neuer did repent for doing good
Nor shall not now for in companions
That do conuerse and waste the time together
Whose soules doe beare an egal yoke of loue
There must be needs a like proportion
Of lyniaments of manners and of spirit
Which makes me thinke that this Anthonio
Being the bosome louer of my Lord
Must needs be like my Lord If it be so
How little is the cost I haue bestowed
In purchasing the semblance of my soule
From out the state of hellish cruelty
This comes too neere the praising of my selfe
Therefore no more of it heere other things
Lorenso I commit into your hands
The husbandry and mannage of my house
Vntill my Lords returne for mine owne part
I haue toward heauen breathd a secret vow
To liue in prayer and contemplation
Onely attended by Nerrissa heere
Vntill her husband and my Lords returne
There is a monastery too miles off
And there we will abide I doe desire you
Not to denie this imposition
The which my loue and some necessity
Now layes vpon you

   Lorens Madame with all my heart
I shall obey you in all faire commands

   Por My people doe already know my minde
And will acknowledge you and Iessica
In place of Lord Bassanio and my selfe
So far you well till we shall meete againe

   Lor Faire thoughts  happy houres attend on you

   Iessi I wish your Ladiship all hearts content

   Por I thanke you for your wish and am well pleasd
To wish it backe on you faryouwell Iessica

Exeunt

Now Balthaser as I haue euer found thee honest true
So let me finde thee still take this same letter
And vse thou all the indeauor of a man
In speed to Mantua see thou render this
Into my cosins hand Doctor Belario
And looke what notes and garments he doth giue thee
Bring them I pray thee with imagind speed
Vnto the Tranect to the common Ferrie
Which trades to Venice waste no time in words
But get thee gone I shall be there before thee

   Balth Madam I goe with all conuenient speed

   Por Come on Nerissa I haue worke in hand
That you yet know not of weell see our husbands
Before they thinke of vs
  Nerrissa Shall they see vs
  Portia They shall Nerrissa but in such a habit
That they shall thinke we are accomplished
With that we lacke Ile hold thee any wager
When we are both accoutered like yong men
Ile proue the prettier fellow of the two
And weare my dagger with the brauer grace
And speake betweene the change of man and boy
With a reede voyce and turne two minsing steps
Into a manly stride and speake of frayes
Like a fine bragging youth and tell quaint lyes
How honourable Ladies sought my loue
Which I denying they fell sicke and died
I could not doe withall then Ile repent
And wish for all that that I had not kild them
And twentie of these punie lies Ile tell
That men shall sweare I haue discontinued schoole
Aboue a twelue moneth I haue within my minde
A thousand raw tricks of these bragging Iacks
Which I will practise

   Nerris Why shall wee turne to men
  Portia Fie what a questions that
If thou wert nere a lewd interpreter
But come Ile tell thee all my whole deuice
When I am in my coach which stayes for vs
At the Parke gate and therefore haste away
For we must measure twentie miles to day

Exeunt

Enter Clowne and Iessica

  Clown Yes truly for looke you the sinnes of the Father

good cheere for truly I thinke you are damnd there is
but one hope in it that can doe you anie good and that is
but a kinde of bastard hope neither

   Iessica And what hope is that I pray thee
  Clow Marrie you may partlie hope that your father
got you not that you are not the Iewes daughter

   Ies That were a kinde of bastard hope indeed so the

The Lord Bassanio liue an vpright life
For hauing such a blessing in his Lady
He findes the ioyes of heauen heere on earth
And if on earth he doe not meane it it
Is reason he should neuer come to heauen
Why if two gods should play some heauenly match

Paund with the other for the poore rude world
Hath not her fellow

Enter the Duke the Magnificoes Anthonio Bassanio and
Gratiano

   Duke What is Anthonio heere
  Ant Ready so please your grace
  Duke I am sorry for thee thou art come to answere
A stonie aduersary an inhumane wretch
Vncapable of pitty voyd and empty
From any dram of mercie

   Ant I haue heard
Your Grace hath tane great paines to qualifie
His rigorous course but since he stands obdurate
And that no lawful meanes can carrie me
Out of his enuies reach I do oppose
My patience to his fury and am armd
To suffer with a quietnesse of spirit
The very tiranny and rage of his

   Du Go one and cal the Iew into the Court

   Sal He is ready at the doore he comes my Lord
Enter Shylocke

  Du Make roome and let him stand before our face
Shylocke the world thinkes and I thinke so to
That thou but leadest this fashion of thy mallice
To the last houre of act and then tis thought
Thoult shew thy mercy and remorse more strange
Than is thy strange apparant cruelty
And where thou now exactst the penalty
Which is a pound of this poore Merchants flesh
Thou wilt not onely loose the forfeiture
But touchd with humane gentlenesse and loue
Forgiue a moytie of the principall
Glancing an eye of pitty on his losses
That haue of late so hudled on his backe
Enow to presse a royall Merchant downe
And plucke commiseration of his state
From brassie bosomes and rough hearts of flints
From stubborne Turkes and Tarters neuer traind
To offices of tender curtesie
We all expect a gentle answer Iew
  Iew I haue possest your grace of what I purpose
And by our holy Sabbath haue I sworne
To haue the due and forfeit of my bond
If you denie it let the danger light
Vpon your Charter and your Cities freedome
Youl aske me why I rather choose to haue
A weight of carrion flesh then to receiue
Three thousand Ducats Ile not answer that
But say it is my humor Is it answered
What if my house be troubled with a Rat
And I be pleasd to giue ten thousand Ducates
To haue it baind What are you answerd yet
Some men there are loue not a gaping Pigge
Some that are mad if they behold a Cat
And others when the bagpipe sings ith nose
Cannot containe their Vrine for affection
Masters of passion swayes it to the moode
Of what it likes or loaths now for your answer
As there is no firme reason to be rendred
Why he cannot abide a gaping Pigge
Why he a harmlesse necessarie Cat
Why he a woollen bagpipe but of force
Must yeeld to such ineuitable shame
As to offend himselfe being offended
So can I giue no reason nor I will not
More then a lodgd hate and a certaine loathing
I beare Anthonio that I follow thus
A loosing suite against him Are you answered
  Bass This is no answer thou vnfeeling man
To excuse the currant of thy cruelty

   Iew I am not bound to please thee with my answer

   Bass Do all men kil the things they do not loue
  Iew Hates any man the thing he would not kill
  Bass Euerie offence is not a hate at first

   Iew What wouldst thou haue a Serpent sting thee
twice
  Ant I pray you thinke you question with the Iew
You may as well go stand vpon the beach
And bid the maine flood baite his vsuall height
Or euen as well vse question with the Wolfe
The Ewe bleate for the Lambe
You may as well forbid the Mountaine Pines
To wagge their high tops and to make no noise
When they are fretted with the gusts of heauen
You may as well do any thing most hard
As seeke to soften that then which what harder
His Iewish heart Therefore I do beseech you
Make no more offers vse no farther meanes
But with all briefe and plaine conueniencie
Let me haue iudgement and the Iew his will

   Bas For thy three thousand Ducates heere is six

   Iew If euerie Ducat in sixe thousand Ducates
Were in sixe parts and euery part a Ducate
I would not draw them I would haue my bond
  Du How shalt thou hope for mercie rendring none
  Iew What iudgement shall I dread doing no wrong
You haue among you many a purchast slaue
Which like your Asses and your Dogs and Mules
You vse in abiect and in slauish parts
Because you bought them Shall I say to you
Let them be free marrie them to your heires
Why sweate they vnder burthens Let their beds
Be made as soft as yours and let their pallats
Be seasond with such Viands you will answer
The slaues are ours So do I answer you
The pound of flesh which I demand of him
Is deerely bought tis mine and I will haue it
If you deny me fie vpon your Law
There is no force in the decrees of Venice
I stand for iudgement answer Shall I haue it
  Du Vpon my power I may dismisse this Court
Vnlesse Bellario a learned Doctor
Whom I haue sent for to determine this
Come heere to day

   Sal My Lord heere stayes without
A Messenger with Letters from the Doctor
New come from Padua

   Du Bring vs the Letters Call the Messengers

   Bass Good cheere Anthonio What man corage yet
The Iew shall haue my flesh blood bones and all
Ere thou shalt loose for me one drop of blood

   Ant I am a tainted Weather of the flocke
Meetest for death the weakest kinde of fruite
Drops earliest to the ground and so let me
You cannot better be employd Bassanio
Then to liue still and write mine Epitaph
Enter Nerrissa

  Du Came you from Padua from Bellario
  Ner From both
My Lord Bellario greets your Grace

   Bas Why dost thou whet thy knife so earnestly
  Iew To cut the forfeiture from that bankrout there

   Gra Not on thy soale but on thy soule harsh Iew
Thou makst thy knife keene but no mettall can
No not the hangmans Axe beare halfe the keennesse
Of thy sharpe enuy Can no prayers pierce thee
  Iew No none that thou hast wit enough to make

   Gra O be thou damnd inexecrable dogge
And for thy life let iustice be accusd
Thou almost makst me wauer in my faith
To hold opinion with Pythagoras
That soules of Animals infuse themselues
Into the trunkes of men Thy currish spirit
Gouernd a Wolfe who hangd for humane slaughter
Euen from the gallowes did his fell soule fleet
And whilst thou layest in thy vnhallowed dam
Infusd it selfe in thee For thy desires
Are Woluish bloody sterud and rauenous

   Iew Till thou canst raile the seale from off my bond
Thou but offendst thy Lungs to speake so loud
Repaire thy wit good youth or it will fall
To endlesse ruine I stand heere for Law

   Du This Letter from Bellario doth commend
A yong and Learned Doctor in our Court
Where is he
  Ner He attendeth heere hard by
To know your answer whether youl admit him

   Du With all my heart Some three or four of you
Go giue him curteous conduct to this place
Meane time the Court shall heare Bellarioes Letter
Your Grace shall vnderstand that at the receite of your
Letter I am very sicke but in the instant that your messenger
came in louing visitation was with me a yong Doctor
of Rome his name is Balthasar I acquainted him with
the cause in Controuersie betweene the Iew and Anthonio
the Merchant We turnd ore many Bookes together hee is
furnished with my opinion which bettred with his owne learning
the greatnesse whereof I cannot enough commend comes
with him at my importunity to fill vp your Graces request in
my sted I beseech you let his lacke of years be no impediment
to let him lacke a reuerend estimation for I neuer knewe so
yong a body with so old a head I leaue him to your gracious
acceptance whose trial shall better publish his commendation
Enter Portia for Balthazar

  Duke You heare the learnd Bellario what he writes
And heere I take it is the Doctor come
Giue me your hand Came you from old Bellario
  Por I did my Lord

   Du You are welcome take your place
Are you acquainted with the difference
That holds this present question in the Court

   Por I am enformed throughly of the cause
Which is the Merchant heere and which the Iew
  Du Anthonio and old Shylocke both stand forth

   Por Is your name Shylocke
  Iew Shylocke is my name

   Por Of a strange nature is the sute you follow
Yet in such rule that the Venetian Law
Cannot impugne you as you do proceed
You stand within his danger do you not
  Ant I so he sayes

   Por Do you confesse the bond
  Ant I do

   Por Then must the Iew be mercifull

   Iew On what compulsion must I  Tell me that

   Por The quality of mercy is not straind
It droppeth as the gentle raine from heauen
Vpon the place beneath It is twice blest
It blesseth him that giues and him that takes
Tis mightiest in the mightiest it becomes
The throned Monarch better then his Crowne
His Scepter shewes the force of temporall power
The attribute to awe and Maiestie
Wherein doth sit the dread and feare of Kings
But mercy is aboue this sceptred sway
It is enthroned in the hearts of Kings
It is an attribute to God himselfe
And earthly power doth then shew likest Gods
When mercie seasons Iustice Therefore Iew
Though Iustice be thy plea consider this
That in the course of Iustice none of vs
Should see saluation we do pray for mercie
And that same prayer doth teach vs all to render
The deeds of mercie I haue spoke thus much
To mittigate the iustice of thy plea
Which if thou follow this strict course of Venice
Must needes giue sentence gainst the Merchant there

   Shy My deeds vpon my head I craue the Law
The penaltie and forfeite of my bond

   Por Is he not able to discharge the money
  Bas Yes heere I tender it for him in the Court
Yea twice the summe if that will not suffice
I will be bound to pay it ten times ore
On forfeit of my hands my head my heart
If this will not suffice it must appeare
That malice beares downe truth And I beseech you
Wrest once the Law to your authority
To do a great right do a little wrong
And curbe this cruell diuell of his will

   Por It must not be there is no power in Venice
Can alter a decree established
Twill be recorded for a President
And many an error by the same example
Will rush into the state It cannot be

   Iew A Daniel come to iudgement yea a Daniel
O wise young Iudge how do I honour thee

   Por I pray you let me looke vpon the bond

   Iew Heere tis most reuerend Doctor heere it is

   Por Shylocke theres thrice thy monie offered thee

   Shy An oath an oath I haue an oath in heauen
Shall I lay periurie vpon my soule
No not for Venice

   Por Why this bond is forfeit
And lawfully by this the Iew may claime
A pound of flesh to be by him cut off
Neerest the Merchants heart be mercifull
Take thrice thy money bid me teare the bond

   Iew When it is paid according to the tenure
It doth appeare you are a worthy Iudge
You know the Law your exposition
Hath beene most sound I charge you by the Law
Whereof you are a welldeseruing pillar
Proceede to iudgement By my soule I sweare
There is no power in the tongue of man
To alter me I stay heere on my bond

   An Most heartily I do beseech the Court
To giue the iudgement

   Por Why then thus it is
You must prepare your bosome for his knife

   Iew O noble Iudge O excellent yong man

   Por For the intent and purpose of the Law
Hath full relation to the penaltie
Which heere appeareth due vpon the bond

   Iew Tis verie true O wise and vpright Iudge
How much more elder art thou then thy lookes
  Por Therefore lay bare your bosome

   Iew I his brest
So sayes the bond doth it not noble Iudge
Neerest his heart those are the very words

   Por It is so Are there ballance heere to weigh the
flesh
  Iew I haue them ready

   Por Haue by some Surgeon Shylock on your charge
To stop his wounds least he should bleede to death

   Iew It is not nominated in the bond
  Por It is not so exprest but what of that
Twere good you do so much for charitie

   Iew I cannot finde it tis not in the bond

   Por Come Merchant haue you any thing to say
  Ant But little I am armd and well prepard
Giue me your hand Bassanio fare you well
Greeue not that I am falne to this for you
For heerein fortune shewes her selfe more kinde
Then is her custome It is still her vse
To let the wretched man outliue his wealth
To view with hollow eye and wrinkled brow
An age of pouerty From which lingring penance
Of such miserie doth she cut me off
Commend me to your honourable Wife
Tell her the processe of Anthonios end
Say how I loud you speake me faire in death
And when the tale is told bid her be iudge
Whether Bassanio had not once a Loue
Repent not you that you shall loose your friend
And he repents not that he payes your debt
For if the Iew do cut but deepe enough
Ile pay it instantly with all my heart

   Bas Anthonio I am married to a wife
Which is as deere to me as life it selfe
But life it selfe my wife and all the world
Are not with me esteemd aboue thy life
I would loose all I sacrifice them all
Heere to this deuill to deliuer you

   Por Your wife would giue you little thanks for that
If she were by to heare you make the offer

   Gra I haue a wife whom I protest I loue
I would she were in heauen so she could
Intreat some power to change this currish Iew

   Ner Tis well you offer it behinde her backe
The wish would make else an vnquiet house

   Iew These be the Christian husbands I haue a daughter
Would any of the stocke of Barrabas
Had beene her husband rather then a Christian
We trifle time I pray thee pursue sentence

   Por A pound of that same marchants flesh is thine
The Court awards it and the law doth giue it

   Iew Most rightfull Iudge

   Por And you must cut this flesh from off his breast
The Law allowes it and the Court awards it

   Iew Most learned Iudge a sentence come prepare

   Por Tarry a little there is something else
This bond doth giue thee heere no iot of bloud
The words expresly are a pound of flesh
Then take thy bond take thou thy pound of flesh
But in the cutting it if thou dost shed
One drop of Christian bloud thy lands and goods
Are by the Lawes of Venice confiscate
Vnto the state of Venice

   Gra O vpright Iudge
Marke Iew o learned Iudge

   Shy Is that the law
  Por Thy selfe shalt see the Act
For as thou vrgest iustice be assurd
Thou shalt haue iustice more then thou desirest

   Gra O learned Iudge mark Iew a learned Iudge

   Iew I take this offer then pay the bond thrice
And let the Christian goe

   Bass Heere is the money

   Por Soft the Iew shall haue all iustice soft no haste
He shall haue nothing but the penalty

   Gra O Iew an vpright Iudge a learned Iudge

   Por Therefore prepare thee to cut off the flesh
Shed thou no bloud nor cut thou lesse nor more
But iust a pound of flesh if thou takst more
Or lesse then a iust pound be it so much
As makes it light or heauy in the substance
Or the deuision of the twentieth part
Of one poore scruple nay if the scale doe turne
But in the estimation of a hayre
Thou diest and all thy goods are confiscate

   Gra A second Daniel a Daniel Iew
Now infidell I haue thee on the hip

   Por Why doth the Iew pause take thy forfeiture

   Shy Giue me my principall and let me goe

   Bass I haue it ready for thee heere it is

   Por He hath refusd it in the open Court
He shall haue meerly iustice and his bond

   Gra A Daniel still say I a second Daniel
I thanke thee Iew for teaching me that word

   Shy Shall I not haue barely my principall
  Por Thou shalt haue nothing but the forfeiture
To be taken so at thy perill Iew

   Shy Why then the Deuill giue him good of it
Ile stay no longer question

   Por Tarry Iew
The Law hath yet another hold on you
It is enacted in the Lawes of Venice
If it be proued against an Alien
That by direct or indirect attempts
He seeke the life of any Citizen
The party gainst the which he doth contriue
Shall seaze one halfe his goods the other halfe
Comes to the priuie coffer of the State
And the offenders life lies in the mercy
Of the Duke onely gainst all other voice
In which predicament I say thou standst
For it appeares by manifest proceeding
That indirectly and directly to
Thou hast contriud against the very life
Of the defendant and thou hast incurd
The danger formerly by me rehearst
Downe therefore and beg mercy of the Duke

   Gra Beg that thou maist haue leaue to hang thy selfe
And yet thy wealth being forfeit to the state
Thou hast not left the value of a cord
Therefore thou must be hangd at the states charge

   Duk That thou shalt see the difference of our spirit
I pardon thee thy life before thou aske it
For halfe thy wealth it is Anthonios
The other halfe comes to the generall state
Which humblenesse may driue vnto a fine

   Por I for the state not for Anthonio

   Shy Nay take my life and all pardon not that
You take my house when you do take the prop
That doth sustaine my house you take my life
When you doe take the meanes whereby I liue

   Por What mercy can you render him Anthonio
  Gra A halter gratis nothing else for Gods sake

   Ant So please my Lord the Duke and all the Court
To quit the fine for one halfe of his goods
I am content so he will let me haue
The other halfe in vse to render it
Vpon his death vnto the Gentleman
That lately stole his daughter
Two things prouided more that for this fauour
He presently become a Christian
The other that he doe record a gift
Heere in the Court of all he dies possest
Vnto his sonne Lorenzo and his daughter

   Duk He shall doe this or else I doe recant
The pardon that I late pronounced heere

   Por Art thou contented Iew what dost thou say
  Shy I am content

   Por Clarke draw a deed of gift

   Shy I pray you giue me leaue to goe from hence
I am not well send the deed after me
And I will signe it

   Duke Get thee gone but doe it

   Gra In christning thou shalt haue two godfathers
Had I been iudge thou shouldst haue had ten more
To bring thee to the gallowes not to the font
Enter

  Du Sir I intreat you with me home to dinner

When the sweet winde did gently kisse the trees
And they did make no noyse in such a night
Troylus me thinkes mounted the Troian walls
And sighd his soule toward the Grecian tents
Where Cressed lay that night

   Iessi I would outnight you did no body come
But harke I heare the footing of a man
Enter Messenger

  Lor Who comes so fast in silence of the night
  Mes A friend

   Loren A friend what friend your name I pray you friend
  Mes Stephano is my name and I bring word
My Mistresse will before the breake of day
Be heere at Belmont she doth stray about
By holy crosses where she kneeles and prayes
For happy wedlocke houres

   Loren Who comes with her
  Mes None but a holy Hermit and her maid
I pray you is my Master yet returnd
  Loren He is not nor we haue not heard from him
But goe we in I pray thee Iessica
And ceremoniously let vs prepare
Some welcome for the Mistresse of the house
Enter Clowne

  Clo Sola sola wo ha ho sola sola

   Loren Who calls
  Clo Sola did you see Master Lorenzo  Master Lorenzo

  Lor Leaue hollowing man heere

   Clo Sola where where
  Lor Heere
  Clo Tel him thers a Post come from my Master with
his horne full of good newes my Master will be here ere
morning sweete soule

   Loren Lets in and there expect their comming
And yet no matter why should we goe in
My friend Stephen signifie pray you
Within the house your Mistresse is at hand
And bring your musique foorth into the ayre
How sweet the moonelight sleepes vpon this banke
Heere will we sit and let the sounds of musicke
Creepe in our eares soft stilnes and the night
Become the tutches of sweet harmonie
Sit Iessica looke how the floore of heauen
Is thicke inlayed with pattens of bright gold
Theres not the smallest orbe which thou beholdst
But in his motion like an Angell sings
Still quiring to the young eyed Cherubins
Such harmonie is in immortall soules
But whilst this muddy vesture of decay
Doth grosly close in it we cannot heare it
Come hoe and wake Diana with a hymne
With sweetest tutches pearce your Mistresse eare
And draw her home with musicke

   Iessi I am neuer merry when I heare sweet musique

Play musicke

  Lor The reason is your spirits are attentiue
For doe but note a wilde and wanton heard
Or race of youthful and vnhandled colts
Fetching mad bounds bellowing and neighing loud
Which is the hot condition of their bloud
If they but heare perchance a trumpet sound
Or any ayre of musicke touch their eares
You shall perceiue them make a mutuall stand
Their sauage eyes turnd to a modest gaze
By the sweet power of musicke therefore the Poet
Did faine that Orpheus drew trees stones and floods
Since naught so stockish hard and full of rage
But musicke for time doth change his nature
The man that hath no musicke in himselfe
Nor is not moued with concord of sweet sounds
Is fit for treasons stratagems and spoyles
The motions of his spirit are dull as night
And his affections darke as Erobus
Let no such man be trusted marke the musicke
Enter Portia and Nerrissa

  Por That light we see is burning in my hall
How farre that little candell throwes his beames
So shines a good deed in a naughty world

   Ner When the moone shone we did not see the candle
  Por So doth the greater glory dim the lesse
A substitute shines brightly as a King
Vntill a King be by and then his state
Empties it selfe as doth an inland brooke
Into the maine of waters musique harke

Musicke

  Ner It is your musicke Madame of the house

   Por Nothing is good I see without respect
Methinkes it sounds much sweeter then by day
  Ner Silence bestowes that vertue on it Madam

   Por The Crow doth sing as sweetly as the Larke
When neither is attended and I thinke
The Nightingale if she should sing by day
When euery Goose is cackling would be thought
No better a Musitian then the Wren
How many things by season seasond are
To their right praise and true perfection
Peace how the Moone sleepes with Endimion
And would not be awakd

Musicke ceases

  Lor That is the voice
Or I am much deceiud of Portia

   Por He knowes me as the blinde man knowes the
Cuckow by the bad voice
  Lor Deere Lady welcome home
  Por We haue bene praying for our husbands welfare
Which speed we hope the better for our words
Are they returnd
  Lor Madam they are not yet
But there is come a Messenger before
To signifie their comming

   Por Go in Nerrissa
Giue order to my seruants that they take
No note at all of our being absent hence
Nor you Lorenzo Iessica nor you

A Tucket sounds

  Lor Your husband is at hand I heare his Trumpet
We are no telltales Madam feare you not

   Por This night methinkes is but the daylight sicke
It lookes a little paler tis a day
Such as the day is when the Sun is hid
Enter Bassanio Anthonio Gratiano and their Followers

  Bas We should hold day with the Antipodes
If you would walke in absence of the sunne

   Por Let me giue light but let me not be light
For a light wife doth make a heauie husband
And neuer be Bassanio so for me
But God sort all you are welcome home my Lord

   Bass I thanke you Madam giue welcom to my friend
This is the man this is Anthonio
To whom I am so infinitely bound

   Por You should in all sence be much bound to him
For as I heare he was much bound for you

   Anth No more then I am wel acquitted of

   Por Sir you are verie welcome to our house
It must appeare in other waies then words
Therefore I scant this breathing curtesie

   Gra By yonder Moone I sweare you do me wrong
Infaith I gaue it to the Iudges Clearke
Would he were gelt that had it for my part
Since you do take it Loue so much at hart

   Por A quarrel hoe alreadie whats the matter
  Gra About a hoope of Gold a paltry Ring
That she did giue me whose Poesie was
For all the world like Cutlers Poetry
Vpon a knife Loue mee and leaue mee not

   Ner What talke you of the Poesie or the valew
You swore to me when I did giue it you
That you would weare it til the houre of death
And that it should lye with you in your graue
Though not for me yet for your vehement oaths
You should haue beene respectiue and haue kept it
Gaue it a Iudges Clearke but wel I know
The Clearke wil nere weare haire ons face that had it

   Gra He wil and if he liue to be a man

   Nerrissa I if a Woman liue to be a man

   Gra Now by this hand I gaue it to a youth
A kinde of boy a little scrubbed boy
No higher then thy selfe the Iudges Clearke
A prating boy that beggd it as a Fee
I could not for my heart deny it him

   Por You were too blame I must be plaine with you
To part so slightly with your wiues first gift
A thing stucke on with oathes vpon your finger
And so riueted with faith vnto your flesh
I gaue my Loue a Ring and made him sweare
Neuer to part with it and heere he stands
I dare be sworne for him he would not leaue it
Nor plucke it from his finger for the wealth
That the world masters Now in faith Gratiano
You giue your wife too vnkinde a cause of greefe
And twere to me I should be mad at it

   Bass Why I were best to cut my left hand off
And sweare I lost the Ring defending it

   Gra My Lord Bassanio gaue his Ring away
Vnto the Iudge that begd it and indeede
Deserud it too and then the Boy his Clearke
That tooke some paines in writing he beggd mine
And neyther man nor master would take ought
But the two Rings

   Por What Ring gaue you my Lord
Not that I hope which you receiud of me

   Bass If I could adde a lie vnto a fault
I would deny it but you see my finger
Hath not the Ring vpon it it is gone

   Por Euen so voide is your false heart of truth
By heauen I wil nere come in your bed
Vntil I see the Ring

   Ner Nor I in yours til I againe see mine

   Bass Sweet Portia
If you did know to whom I gaue the Ring
If you did know for whom I gaue the Ring
And would conceiue for what I gaue the Ring
And how vnwillingly I left the Ring
When nought would be accepted but the Ring
You would abate the strength of your displeasure
  Por If you had knowne the vertue of the Ring
Or halfe her worthinesse that gaue the Ring
Or your owne honour to containe the Ring
You would not then haue parted with the Ring
What man is there so much vnreasonable
If you had pleasd to haue defended it
With any termes of Zeale wanted the modestie
To vrge the thing held as a ceremonie
Nerrissa teaches me what to beleeue
Ile die fort but some Woman had the Ring
  Bass No by mine honor Madam by my soule
No Woman had it but a ciuill Doctor
Which did refuse three thousand Ducates of me
And begd the Ring the which I did denie him
And sufferd him to go displeasd away
Euen he that had held vp the verie life
Of my deere friend What should I say sweete Lady
I was inforcd to send it after him
I was beset with shame and curtesie
My honor would not let ingratitude
So much besmeare it Pardon me good Lady
And by these blessed Candles of the night
Had you bene there I thinke you would haue begd
The Ring of me to giue the worthie Doctor
  Por Let not that Doctor ere come neere my house
Since he hath got the iewell that I loued
And that which you did sweare to keepe for me
I will become as liberall as you
Ile not deny him any thing I haue
No not my body nor my husbands bed
Know him I shall I am well sure of it
Lie not a night from home Watch me like Argos
If you doe not if I be left alone
Now by mine honour which is yet mine owne
Ile haue the Doctor for my bedfellow

   Nerrissa And I his Clarke therefore be well aduisd
How you doe leaue me to mine owne protection

   Gra Well doe you so let not me take him then
For if I doe ile mar the yong Clarks pen

   Ant I am th vnhappy subiect of these quarrels

   Por Sir grieue not you
You are welcome notwithstanding

   Bas Portia forgiue me this enforced wrong
And in the hearing of these manie friends
I sweare to thee euen by thine owne faire eyes
Wherein I see my selfe

   Por Marke you but that
In both my eyes he doubly sees himselfe
In each eye one sweare by your double selfe
And theres an oath of credit

   Bas Nay but heare me
Pardon this fault and by my soule I sweare
I neuer more will breake an oath with thee

   Anth I once did lend my bodie for thy wealth
Which but for him that had your husbands ring
Had quite miscarried I dare be bound againe
My soule vpon the forfeit that your Lord
Will neuer more breake faith aduisedlie

   Por Then you shall be his suretie giue him this
And bid him keepe it better then the other

   Ant Heere Lord Bassanio swear to keep this ring

   Bass By heauen it is the same I gaue the Doctor

   Por I had it of him pardon Bassanio
For by this ring the Doctor lay with me

   Ner And pardon me my gentle Gratiano
For that same scrubbed boy the Doctors Clarke
In liew of this last night did lye with me

   Gra Why this is like the mending of high waies
In Sommer where the waies are faire enough
What are we Cuckolds ere we haue deserud it

   Por Speake not so grossely you are all amazd
Heere is a letter reade it at your leysure
It comes from Padua from Bellario
There you shall finde that Portia was the Doctor
Nerrissa there her Clarke Lorenzo heere
Shall witnesse I set forth as soone as you
And but eun now returnd I haue not yet
Entred my house Anthonio you are welcome
And I haue better newes in store for you
Then you expect vnseale this letter soone
There you shall finde three of your Argosies
Are richly come to harbour sodainlie
You shall not know by what strange accident
I chanced on this letter

   Antho I am dumbe

   Bass Were you the Doctor and I knew you not
  Gra Were you the Clark that is to make me cuckold

   Ner I but the Clark that neuer meanes to doe it
Vnlesse he liue vntill he be a man

   Bass Sweet Doctor you shall be my bedfellow
When I am absent then lie with my wife

   An Sweet Ladie you haue giuen me life  liuing
For heere I reade for certaine that my ships
Are safelie come to Rode

   Por How now Lorenzo
My Clarke hath some good comforts to for you

   Ner I and Ile giue them him without a fee
There doe I giue to you and Iessica
From the rich Iewe a speciall deed of gift
After his death of all he dies possessd of

   Loren Faire Ladies you drop Manna in the way
Of starued people

   Por It is almost morning
And yet I am sure you are not satisfied
Of these euents at full Let vs goe in
And charge vs there vpon intergatories
And we will answer all things faithfully

   Gra Let it be so the first intergatory
That my Nerrissa shall be sworne on is
Whether till the next night she had rather stay
Or goe to bed now being two houres to day
But were the day come I should wish it darke
Till I were couching with the Doctors Clarke
Well while I liue Ile feare no other thing
So sore as keeping safe Nerrissas ring
